.IX Title "PERLFAQ2 1"
.TH PERLFAQ2 1 "perl v5.6.1" "2001-04-08" "Perl Programmers Reference Guide"
.UC
.SH "NAME"
perlfaq2 \- Obtaining and Learning about Perl ($Revision: 1.32 $, \f(CW$Date:\fR 1999/10/14 18:46:09 $)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This section of the \s-1FAQ\s0 answers questions about where to find
source and documentation for Perl, support, and
related matters.
.Sh "What machines support Perl?  Where do I get it?"
.IX Subsection "What machines support Perl?  Where do I get it?"
The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the perl
development team) is distributed only in source code form.  You
can find this at http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz , which
is in a standard Internet format (a gzipped archive in \s-1POSIX\s0 tar format).
.PP
Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms.  Virtually
all known and current Unix derivatives are supported (Perl's native
platform), as are other systems like \s-1VMS\s0, \s-1DOS\s0, \s-1OS/2\s0, Windows,
\&\s-1QNX\s0, BeOS, \s-1OS\s0 X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.
.PP
Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms, including
Apple systems, can be found http://www.cpan.org/ports/ directory.
Because these are not part of the standard distribution, they may
and in fact do differ from the base Perl port in a variety of ways.
You'll have to check their respective release notes to see just
what the differences are.  These differences can be either positive
(e.g. extensions for the features of the particular platform that
are not supported in the source release of perl) or negative (e.g.
might be based upon a less current source release of perl).
.Sh "How can I get a binary version of Perl?"
.IX Subsection "How can I get a binary version of Perl?"
If you don't have a C compiler because your vendor for whatever
reasons did not include one with your system, the best thing to do is
grab a binary version of gcc from the net and use that to compile perl
with.  \s-1CPAN\s0 only has binaries for systems that are terribly hard to
get free compilers for, not for Unix systems.
.PP
Some URLs that might help you are:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    http://www.cpan.org/ports/
\&    http://language.perl.com/info/software.html
.Ve
Someone looking for a Perl for Win16 might look to Laszlo Molnar's djgpp
port in http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos , which comes with clear
installation instructions.  A simple installation guide for \s-1MS-DOS\s0 using
Ilya Zakharevich's \s-1OS/2\s0 port is available at
http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.html
and similarly for Windows 3.1 at http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.html .
.Sh "I don't have a C compiler on my system.  How can I compile perl?"
.IX Subsection "I don't have a C compiler on my system.  How can I compile perl?"
Since you don't have a C compiler, you're doomed and your vendor
should be sacrificed to the Sun gods.  But that doesn't help you.
.PP
What you need to do is get a binary version of gcc for your system
first.  Consult the Usenet FAQs for your operating system for
information on where to get such a binary version.
.Sh "I copied the Perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't work."
.IX Subsection "I copied the Perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't work."
That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ.
You really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will
eventually live on, and then type \f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR.  Most other
approaches are doomed to failure.
.PP
One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print out
the hard-coded \f(CW@INC\fR that perl looks through for libraries:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    % perl -e 'print join("\en",@INC)'
.Ve
If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system, then you
may need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or create
symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately.  \f(CW@INC\fR is also printed as
part of the output of
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    % perl -V
.Ve
You might also want to check out
the How do I keep my own module/library directory? entry in the perlfaq8 manpage.
.Sh "I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but gdbm/dynamic loading/malloc/linking/... failed.  How do I make it work?"
.IX Subsection "I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but gdbm/dynamic loading/malloc/linking/... failed.  How do I make it work?"
Read the \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR file, which is part of the source distribution.
It describes in detail how to cope with most idiosyncrasies that the
Configure script can't work around for any given system or
architecture.
.Sh "What modules and extensions are available for Perl?  What is \s-1CPAN\s0?  What does CPAN/src/... mean?"
.IX Subsection "What modules and extensions are available for Perl?  What is CPAN?  What does CPAN/src/... mean?"
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a ~700mb archive
replicated on nearly 200 machines all over the world.  \s-1CPAN\s0 contains
source code, non-native ports, documentation, scripts, and many
third-party modules and extensions, designed for everything from
commercial database interfaces to keyboard/screen control to web
walking and \s-1CGI\s0 scripts.  The master web site for \s-1CPAN\s0 is
http://www.cpan.org/ and there is the \s-1CPAN\s0 Multiplexer at
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/CPAN.html which will choose a mirror near you
via \s-1DNS\s0.  See http://www.perl.com/CPAN (without a slash at the
end) for how this process works. Also, http://mirror.cpan.org/
has a nice interface to the http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY
mirror directory.
.PP
See the \s-1CPAN\s0 \s-1FAQ\s0 at http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html for
answers to the most frequently asked questions about \s-1CPAN\s0
including how to become a mirror.
.PP
CPAN/path/... is a naming convention for files available on \s-1CPAN\s0
sites.  \s-1CPAN\s0 indicates the base directory of a \s-1CPAN\s0 mirror, and the
rest of the path is the path from that directory to the file.  For
instance, if you're using ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN
as your \s-1CPAN\s0 site, the file CPAN/misc/japh is downloadable as
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh .
.PP
Considering that there are close to two thousand existing modules in
the archive, one probably exists to do nearly anything you can think of.
Current categories under CPAN/modules/by-category/ include Perl core
modules; development support; operating system interfaces; networking,
devices, and interprocess communication; data type utilities; database
interfaces; user interfaces; interfaces to other languages; filenames,
file systems, and file locking; internationalization and locale; world
wide web support; server and daemon utilities; archiving and
compression; image manipulation; mail and news; control flow
utilities; filehandle and I/O; Microsoft Windows modules; and
miscellaneous modules.
.PP
See http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html or
http://search.cpan.org/ for a more complete list of modules by category.
.Sh "Is there an \s-1ISO\s0 or \s-1ANSI\s0 certified version of Perl?"
.IX Subsection "Is there an ISO or ANSI certified version of Perl?"
Certainly not.  Larry expects that he'll be certified before Perl is.
.Sh "Where can I get information on Perl?"
.IX Subsection "Where can I get information on Perl?"
The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl distribution.
If you have Perl installed locally, you probably have the documentation
installed as well: type \f(CW\*(C`man perl\*(C'\fR if you're on a system resembling Unix.
This will lead you to other important man pages, including how to set your
\&\f(CW$MANPATH\fR.  If you're not on a Unix system, access to the documentation
will be different; for example, documentation might only be in \s-1HTML\s0 format.  All
proper Perl installations have fully-accessible documentation.
.PP
You might also try \f(CW\*(C`perldoc perl\*(C'\fR in case your system doesn't
have a proper man command, or it's been misinstalled.  If that doesn't
work, try looking in /usr/local/lib/perl5/pod for documentation.
.PP
If all else fails, consult http://perldoc.cpan.org/ or
http://www.perldoc.com/ both offer the complete documentation
in html format.
.PP
Many good books have been written about Perl\*(--see the section below
for more details.
.PP
Tutorial documents are included in current or upcoming Perl releases
include the perltoot manpage for objects or the perlboot manpage for a beginner's
approach to objects, the perlopentut manpage for file opening semantics,
the perlreftut manpage for managing references, the perlretut manpage for regular
expressions, the perlthrtut manpage for threads, the perldebtut manpage for debugging,
and the perlxstut manpage for linking C and Perl together.  There may be more
by the time you read this.  The following URLs might also be of
assistance:

.Ve
.Sh "What are the Perl newsgroups on Usenet?  Where do I post questions?"
.IX Subsection "What are the Perl newsgroups on Usenet?  Where do I post questions?"
The now defunct comp.lang.perl newsgroup has been superseded by the
following groups:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    comp.lang.perl.announce             Moderated announcement group
\&    comp.lang.perl.misc                 Very busy group about Perl in general
\&    comp.lang.perl.moderated            Moderated discussion group
\&    comp.lang.perl.modules              Use and development of Perl modules
\&    comp.lang.perl.tk                   Using Tk (and X) from Perl
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi  Writing CGI scripts for the Web.
.Ve
There is also Usenet gateway to the mailing list used by the crack
Perl development team (perl5\-porters) at
news://news.perl.com/perl.porters-gw/ .
.Sh "Where should I post source code?"
.IX Subsection "Where should I post source code?"
You should post source code to whichever group is most appropriate, but
feel free to cross-post to comp.lang.perl.misc.  If you want to cross-post
to alt.sources, please make sure it follows their posting standards,
including setting the Followup-To header line to \s-1NOT\s0 include alt.sources;
see their \s-1FAQ\s0 (http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/) for details.
.PP
If you're just looking for software, first use Google
(http://www.google.com), Deja (http://www.deja.com), and
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 Search (http://search.cpan.org).  This is faster and more
productive than just posting a request.
.Sh "Perl Books"
.IX Subsection "Perl Books"
A number of books on Perl and/or \s-1CGI\s0 programming are available.  A few of
these are good, some are \s-1OK\s0, but many aren't worth your money.  Tom
Christiansen maintains a list of these books, some with extensive
reviews, at http://www.perl.com/perl/critiques/index.html .
.PP
The incontestably definitive reference book on Perl, written by
the creator of Perl, is now (July 2000) in its third edition:

.Ve
Despite the picture at the \s-1URL\s0 above, the second edition of \*(L"Llama
Book\*(R" really has a blue cover and was updated for the 5.004 release
of Perl.  Various foreign language editions are available, including
\&\fILearning Perl on Win32 Systems\fR (the \*(L"Gecko Book\*(R").
.PP
If you're not an accidental programmer, but a more serious and possibly
even degreed computer scientist who doesn't need as much hand-holding as
we try to provide in the Llama or its defurred cousin the Gecko, please
check out the delightful book, \fIPerl: The Programmer's Companion\fR,
written by Nigel Chapman.
.PP
Addison-Wesley (http://www.awlonline.com/) and Manning
(http://www.manning.com/) are also publishers of some fine Perl books
such as Object Oriented Programming with Perl by Damian Conway and
Network Programming with Perl by Lincoln Stein.
.PP
An excellent technical book discounter is Bookpool at
http://www.bookpool.com/ where a 30% discount or more is not unusual.

What follows is a list of the books that the \s-1FAQ\s0 authors found personally
useful.  Your mileage may (but, we hope, probably won't) vary.

which is at /CPAN/MIRRORED.BY or at http://mirror.cpan.org/.
From there you can find the quickest site for you.  Remember, the

You might want to trim that down a bit, though.
.PP
You'll probably want more a sophisticated query and retrieval mechanism
than a file listing, preferably one that allows you to retrieve
articles using a fast-access indices, keyed on at least author, date,
subject, thread (as in \*(L"trn\*(R") and probably keywords.  The best
solution the \s-1FAQ\s0 authors know of is the \s-1MH\s0 pick command, but it is
very slow to select on 18000 articles.

.Sh "Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?"
.IX Subsection "Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?"
In a real sense, Perl already \fIis\fR commercial software: it has a license
that you can grab and carefully read to your manager. It is distributed
in releases and comes in well-defined packages. There is a very large
user community and an extensive literature.  The comp.lang.perl.*
newsgroups and several of the mailing lists provide free answers to your
questions in near real-time.  Perl has traditionally been supported by
Larry, scores of software designers and developers, and myriads of
programmers, all working for free to create a useful thing to make life
better for everyone.
.PP
However, these answers may not suffice for managers who require a
purchase order from a company whom they can sue should anything go awry.
Or maybe they need very serious hand-holding and contractual obligations.
Shrink-wrapped CDs with Perl on them are available from several sources if
that will help.  For example, many Perl books include a distribution of Perl,
as do the O'Reilly Perl Resource Kits (in both the Unix flavor
and in the proprietary Microsoft flavor); the free Unix distributions
also all come with Perl.
.PP
Alternatively, you can purchase commercial incidence based support
through the Perl Clinic.  The following is a commercial from them:

ActiveState Tool Corp. and The Ingram Group.  The operators have many
years of in-depth experience with Perl applications and Perl internals
