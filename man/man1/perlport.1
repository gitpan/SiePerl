.IX Title "PERLPORT 1"
.TH PERLPORT 1 "perl v5.6.1" "2001-03-19" "Perl Programmers Reference Guide"
.UC
.SH "NAME"
perlport \- Writing portable Perl
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Perl runs on numerous operating systems.  While most of them share
much in common, they also have their own unique features.
.PP
This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes portable
Perl code.  That way once you make a decision to write portably,
you know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within them.
.PP
There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one particular
type of computer and taking advantage of a full range of them.
Naturally, as you broaden your range and become more diverse, the
common factors drop, and you are left with an increasingly smaller
area of common ground in which you can operate to accomplish a
particular task.  Thus, when you begin attacking a problem, it is
important to consider under which part of the tradeoff curve you
want to operate.  Specifically, you must decide whether it is
important that the task that you are coding have the full generality
of being portable, or whether to just get the job done right now.
This is the hardest choice to be made.  The rest is easy, because
Perl provides many choices, whichever way you want to approach your
problem.
.PP
Looking at it another way, writing portable code is usually about
willfully limiting your available choices.  Naturally, it takes
discipline and sacrifice to do that.  The product of portability
and convenience may be a constant.  You have been warned.
.PP
Be aware of two important points:
.Ip "Not all Perl programs have to be portable" 4
.IX Item "Not all Perl programs have to be portable"
There is no reason you should not use Perl as a language to glue Unix
tools together, or to prototype a Macintosh application, or to manage the
Windows registry.  If it makes no sense to aim for portability for one
reason or another in a given program, then don't bother.
.Ip "Nearly all of Perl already \fIis\fR portable" 4
.IX Item "Nearly all of Perl already is portable"
Don't be fooled into thinking that it is hard to create portable Perl
code.  It isn't.  Perl tries its level-best to bridge the gaps between
what's available on different platforms, and all the means available to
use those features.  Thus almost all Perl code runs on any machine
without modification.  But there are some significant issues in
writing portable code, and this document is entirely about those issues.
.PP
Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done
using a whole range of platforms, think about writing portable
code.  That way, you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation
choices you can avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give
your users lots of platform choices.  On the other hand, when you have to
take advantage of some unique feature of a particular platform, as is
often the case with systems programming (whether for Unix, Windows,
Mac\ \s-1OS\s0, \s-1VMS\s0, etc.), consider writing platform-specific code.
.PP
When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you
may need to consider only the differences of those particular systems.
The important thing is to decide where the code will run and to be
deliberate in your decision.
.PP
The material below is separated into three main sections: main issues of
portability (the section on "ISSUES", platform-specific issues (the section on "PLATFORMS", and
built-in perl functions that behave differently on various ports
(the section on "FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS".
.PP
This information should not be considered complete; it includes possibly
transient information about idiosyncrasies of some of the ports, almost
all of which are in a state of constant evolution.  Thus, this material
should be considered a perpetual work in progress
(<\s-1IMG\s0 SRC=\*(L"yellow_sign.gif\*(R" ALT=\*(L"Under Construction\*(R">).
.SH "ISSUES"
.IX Header "ISSUES"
.Sh "Newlines"
.IX Subsection "Newlines"
In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by newlines.
Just what is used as a newline may vary from \s-1OS\s0 to \s-1OS\s0.  Unix
traditionally uses \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR, one type of DOSish I/O uses \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR,
and Mac\ \s-1OS\s0 uses \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Perl uses \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR to represent the \*(L"logical\*(R" newline, where what is
logical may depend on the platform in use.  In MacPerl, \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR always
means \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR.  In DOSish perls, \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR usually means \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR, but
when accessing a file in \*(L"text\*(R" mode, \s-1STDIO\s0 translates it to (or
from) \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR, depending on whether you're reading or writing.
Unix does the same thing on ttys in canonical mode.  \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR
is commonly referred to as \s-1CRLF\s0.
.PP
A common cause of unportable programs is the misuse of \fIchop()\fR to trim
newlines:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    # XXX UNPORTABLE!
\&    while(<FILE>) {
\&        chop;
\&        @array = split(/:/);
\&        #...
\&    }
.Ve
You can get away with this on Unix and MacOS (they have a single
character end-of-line), but the same program will break under DOSish
perls because you're only \fIchop()\fRing half the end-of-line.  Instead,
\&\fIchomp()\fR should be used to trim newlines.  The Dunce::Files module can
help audit your code for misuses of \fIchop()\fR.
.PP
When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be sure
to explicitly set $/ to the appropriate value for your file format
before using \fIchomp()\fR.
.PP
Because of the \*(L"text\*(R" mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations
in using \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR on a file accessed in \*(L"text\*(R" mode.
Stick to \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR\-ing to locations you got from \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR (and no
others), and you are usually free to use \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR even
in \*(L"text\*(R" mode.  Using \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR or other file operations
may be non-portable.  If you use \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR on a file, however, you
can usually \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tell\*(C'\fR with arbitrary values in safety.
.PP
A common misconception in socket programming is that \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR eq \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR
everywhere.  When using protocols such as common Internet protocols,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR are called for specifically, and the values of
the logical \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR (carriage return) are not reliable.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\er\en";      # WRONG
\&    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\e015\e012";  # RIGHT
.Ve
However, using \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`\ecM\ecJ\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\ex0D\ex0A\*(C'\fR) can be tedious
and unsightly, as well as confusing to those maintaining the code.  As
such, the Socket module supplies the Right Thing for those who want it.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
\&    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!$CRLF"      # RIGHT
.Ve
When reading from a socket, remember that the default input record
separator \f(CW\*(C`$/\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR, but robust socket code will recognize as
either \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR as end of line:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    while (<SOCKET>) {
\&        # ...
\&    }
.Ve
Because both \s-1CRLF\s0 and \s-1LF\s0 end in \s-1LF\s0, the input record separator can
be set to \s-1LF\s0 and any \s-1CR\s0 stripped later.  Better to write:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
\&    local($/) = LF;      # not needed if $/ is already \e012
.Ve
.Vb 4
\&    while (<SOCKET>) {
\&        s/$CR?$LF/\en/;   # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK
\&    #   s/\e015?\e012/\en/; # same thing
\&    }
.Ve
This example is preferred over the previous one\*(--even for Unix
platforms\*(--because now any \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR's (\f(CW\*(C`\ecM\*(C'\fR's) are stripped out
(and there was much rejoicing).
.PP
Similarly, functions that return text data\*(--such as a function that
fetches a web page\*(--should sometimes translate newlines before
returning the data, if they've not yet been translated to the local
newline representation.  A single line of code will often suffice:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $data =~ s/\e015?\e012/\en/g;
\&    return $data;
.Ve
Some of this may be confusing.  Here's a handy reference to the \s-1ASCII\s0 \s-1CR\s0
and \s-1LF\s0 characters.  You can print it out and stick it in your wallet.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    LF  ==  \e012  ==  \ex0A  ==  \ecJ  ==  ASCII 10
\&    CR  ==  \e015  ==  \ex0D  ==  \ecM  ==  ASCII 13
.Ve
.Vb 8
\&             | Unix | DOS  | Mac  |
\&        ---------------------------
\&        \en   |  LF  |  LF  |  CR  |
\&        \er   |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
\&        \en * |  LF  | CRLF |  CR  |
\&        \er * |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
\&        ---------------------------
\&        * text-mode STDIO
.Ve
The Unix column assumes that you are not accessing a serial line
(like a tty) in canonical mode.  If you are, then \s-1CR\s0 on input becomes
\&\*(L"\en\*(R", and \*(L"\en\*(R" on output becomes \s-1CRLF\s0.
.PP
These are just the most common definitions of \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR in Perl.
There may well be others.
.Sh "Numbers endianness and Width"
.IX Subsection "Numbers endianness and Width"
Different CPUs store integers and floating point numbers in different
orders (called \fIendianness\fR) and widths (32\-bit and 64\-bit being the
most common today).  This affects your programs when they attempt to transfer
numbers in binary format from one \s-1CPU\s0 architecture to another,
usually either \*(L"live\*(R" via network connection, or by storing the
numbers to secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.
.PP
Conflicting storage orders make utter mess out of the numbers.  If a
little-endian host (Intel, \s-1VAX\s0) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in
decimal), a big-endian host (Motorola, Sparc, \s-1PA\s0) reads it as
0x78563412 (2018915346 in decimal).  Alpha and \s-1MIPS\s0 can be either:
Digital/Compaq used/uses them in little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses
them in big-endian mode.  To avoid this problem in network (socket)
connections use the \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR formats \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR, the
\&\*(L"network\*(R" orders.  These are guaranteed to be portable.
.PP
You can explore the endianness of your platform by unpacking a
data structure packed in native format such as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    print unpack("h*", pack("s2", 1, 2)), "\en";
\&    # '10002000' on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in little-endian mode
\&    # '00100020' on e.g. Motorola 68040
.Ve
If you need to distinguish between endian architectures you could use
either of the variables set like so:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $is_big_endian   = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /01/;
\&    $is_little_endian = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /^1/;
.Ve
Differing widths can cause truncation even between platforms of equal
endianness.  The platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
number.  There is no good solution for this problem except to avoid
transferring or storing raw binary numbers.
.PP
One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways.  Either
transfer and store numbers always in text format, instead of raw
binary, or else consider using modules like Data::Dumper (included in
the standard distribution as of Perl 5.005) and Storable.  Keeping
all data as text significantly simplifies matters.
.Sh "Files and Filesystems"
.IX Subsection "Files and Filesystems"
Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical fashion.
So, it is reasonably safe to assume that all platforms support the
notion of a \*(L"path\*(R" to uniquely identify a file on the system.  How
that path is really written, though, differs considerably.
.PP
Although similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
Windows, Mac\ \s-1OS\s0, \s-1OS/2\s0, \s-1VMS\s0, \s-1VOS\s0, \s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0, and probably others.
Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea
of a single root directory.
.PP
\&\s-1DOS\s0, \s-1OS/2\s0, \s-1VMS\s0, \s-1VOS\s0, and Windows can work similarly to Unix with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR
as path separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways (such as having
several root directories and various \*(L"unrooted\*(R" device files such \s-1NIL:\s0
and \s-1LPT:\s0).
.PP
Mac\ \s-1OS\s0 uses \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR as a path separator instead of \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The filesystem may support neither hard links (\f(CW\*(C`link\*(C'\fR) nor
symbolic links (\f(CW\*(C`symlink\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`readlink\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`lstat\*(C'\fR).
.PP
The filesystem may support neither access timestamp nor change
timestamp (meaning that about the only portable timestamp is the
modification timestamp), or one second granularity of any timestamps
(e.g. the \s-1FAT\s0 filesystem limits the time granularity to two seconds).
.PP
\&\s-1VOS\s0 perl can emulate Unix filenames with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as path separator.  The
native pathname characters greater-than, less-than, number-sign, and
percent-sign are always accepted.
.PP
\&\s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0 perl can emulate Unix filenames with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as path
separator, or go native and use \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR for path separator and \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR to
signal filesystems and disk names.
.PP
If all this is intimidating, have no (well, maybe only a little)
fear.  There are modules that can help.  The File::Spec modules
provide methods to do the Right Thing on whatever platform happens
to be running the program.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    use File::Spec::Functions;
\&    chdir(updir());        # go up one directory
\&    $file = catfile(curdir(), 'temp', 'file.txt');
\&    # on Unix and Win32, './temp/file.txt'
\&    # on Mac OS, ':temp:file.txt'
\&    # on VMS, '[.temp]file.txt'
.Ve
File::Spec is available in the standard distribution as of version
5.004_05.  File::Spec::Functions is only in File::Spec 0.7 and later,
and some versions of perl come with version 0.6.  If File::Spec
is not updated to 0.7 or later, you must use the object-oriented
interface from File::Spec (or upgrade File::Spec).
.PP
In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded.
Making them user-supplied or read from a configuration file is
better, keeping in mind that file path syntax varies on different
machines.
.PP
This is especially noticeable in scripts like Makefiles and test suites,
which often assume \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as a path separator for subdirectories.
.PP
Also of use is File::Basename from the standard distribution, which
splits a pathname into pieces (base filename, full path to directory,
and file suffix).
.PP
Even when on a single platform (if you can call Unix a single platform),
remember not to count on the existence or the contents of particular
system-specific files or directories, like \fI/etc/passwd\fR,
\&\fI/etc/sendmail.conf\fR, \fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR, or even \fI/tmp/\fR.  For
example, \fI/etc/passwd\fR may exist but not contain the encrypted
passwords, because the system is using some form of enhanced security.
Or it may not contain all the accounts, because the system is using \s-1NIS\s0. 
If code does need to rely on such a file, include a description of the
file and its format in the code's documentation, then make it easy for
the user to override the default location of the file.
.PP
Don't assume a text file will end with a newline.  They should,
but people forget.
.PP
Do not have two files of the same name with different case, like
\&\fItest.pl\fR and \fITest.pl\fR, as many platforms have case-insensitive
filenames.  Also, try not to have non-word characters (except for \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR)
in the names, and keep them to the 8.3 convention, for maximum
portability, onerous a burden though this may appear.
.PP
Likewise, when using the AutoSplit module, try to keep your functions to
8.3 naming and case-insensitive conventions; or, at the least,
make it so the resulting files have a unique (case-insensitively)
first 8 characters.
.PP
Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all.
Many systems (\s-1DOS\s0, \s-1VMS\s0) cannot have more than one \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR in their filenames.
.PP
Don't assume \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR won't be the first character of a filename.
Always use \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR explicitly to open a file for reading,
unless you want the user to be able to specify a pipe open.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    open(FILE, "< $existing_file") or die $!;
.Ve
If filenames might use strange characters, it is safest to open it
with \f(CW\*(C`sysopen\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR is magic and can
translate characters like \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR, which may
be the wrong thing to do.  (Sometimes, though, it's the right thing.)
.Sh "System Interaction"
.IX Subsection "System Interaction"
Not all platforms provide a command line.  These are usually platforms
that rely primarily on a Graphical User Interface (\s-1GUI\s0) for user

not work everywhere.  This is probably for the user of the program
to deal with, so don't stay up late worrying about it.

if you really have to, make it conditional on \f(CW\*(C`$^O ne 'VMS'\*(C'\fR since in

.Sh "Interprocess Communication (\s-1IPC\s0)"
.IX Subsection "Interprocess Communication (IPC)"
In general, don't directly access the system in code meant to be

that makes being a perl hacker worth being.
.PP
Commands that launch external processes are generally supported on
most platforms (though many of them do not support any type of
forking).  The problem with using them arises from what you invoke
them on.  External tools are often named differently on different
platforms, may not be available in the same location, might accept
different arguments, can behave differently, and often present their
results in a platform-dependent way.  Thus, you should seldom depend
on them to produce consistent results. (Then again, if you're calling 
\&\fInetstat \-a\fR, you probably don't expect it to run on both Unix and \s-1CP/M\s0.)
.PP
One especially common bit of Perl code is opening a pipe to \fBsendmail\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    open(MAIL, '|/usr/lib/sendmail -t') 
\&        or die "cannot fork sendmail: $!";
.Ve
This is fine for systems programming when sendmail is known to be
available.  But it is not fine for many non-Unix systems, and even
some Unix systems that may not have sendmail installed.  If a portable
solution is needed, see the various distributions on \s-1CPAN\s0 that deal
with it.  Mail::Mailer and Mail::Send in the MailTools distribution are
commonly used, and provide several mailing methods, including mail,
sendmail, and direct \s-1SMTP\s0 (via Net::SMTP) if a mail transfer agent is
not available.  Mail::Sendmail is a standalone module that provides
simple, platform-independent mailing.
.PP
The Unix System V \s-1IPC\s0 (\f(CW\*(C`msg*(), sem*(), shm*()\*(C'\fR) is not available
even on all Unix platforms.
.PP
The rule of thumb for portable code is: Do it all in portable Perl, or
use a module (that may internally implement it with platform-specific
code, but expose a common interface).
.Sh "External Subroutines (\s-1XS\s0)"
.IX Subsection "External Subroutines (XS)"
\&\s-1XS\s0 code can usually be made to work with any platform, but dependent
libraries, header files, etc., might not be readily available or
portable, or the \s-1XS\s0 code itself might be platform-specific, just as Perl
code might be.  If the libraries and headers are portable, then it is
normally reasonable to make sure the \s-1XS\s0 code is portable, too.
.PP
A different type of portability issue arises when writing \s-1XS\s0 code:
availability of a C compiler on the end-user's system.  C brings
with it its own portability issues, and writing \s-1XS\s0 code will expose
you to some of those.  Writing purely in Perl is an easier way to
achieve portability.
.Sh "Standard Modules"
.IX Subsection "Standard Modules"
In general, the standard modules work across platforms.  Notable
exceptions are the \s-1CPAN\s0 module (which currently makes connections to external
programs that may not be available), platform-specific modules (like
ExtUtils::MM_VMS), and \s-1DBM\s0 modules.
.PP
There is no one \s-1DBM\s0 module available on all platforms.
SDBM_File and the others are generally available on all Unix and DOSish
ports, but not in MacPerl, where only NBDM_File and DB_File are
available.
.PP
The good news is that at least some \s-1DBM\s0 module should be available, and
AnyDBM_File will use whichever module it can find.  Of course, then
the code needs to be fairly strict, dropping to the greatest common
factor (e.g., not exceeding 1K for each record), so that it will
work with any \s-1DBM\s0 module.  See the AnyDBM_File manpage for more details.
.Sh "Time and Date"
.IX Subsection "Time and Date"
The system's notion of time of day and calendar date is controlled in
widely different ways.  Don't assume the timezone is stored in \f(CW\*(C`$ENV{TZ}\*(C'\fR,
and even if it is, don't assume that you can control the timezone through
that variable.
.PP
Don't assume that the epoch starts at 00:00:00, January 1, 1970,
because that is \s-1OS-\s0 and implementation-specific.  It is better to store a date
in an unambiguous representation.  The \s-1ISO-8601\s0 standard defines
\&\*(L"\s-1YYYY-MM-DD\s0\*(R" as the date format.  A text representation (like \*(L"1987\-12\-18\*(R")
can be easily converted into an OS-specific value using a module like
Date::Parse.  An array of values, such as those returned by
\&\f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR, can be converted to an OS-specific representation using
Time::Local.
.PP
When calculating specific times, such as for tests in time or date modules,
it may be appropriate to calculate an offset for the epoch.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    require Time::Local;
\&    $offset = Time::Local::timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 70);
.Ve
The value for \f(CW\*(C`$offset\*(C'\fR in Unix will be \f(CW\*(C`0\*(C'\fR, but in Mac \s-1OS\s0 will be
some large number.  \f(CW\*(C`$offset\*(C'\fR can then be added to a Unix time value
to get what should be the proper value on any system.
.Sh "Character sets and character encoding"
.IX Subsection "Character sets and character encoding"
Assume little about character sets.  Assume nothing about
numerical values (\f(CW\*(C`ord\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`chr\*(C'\fR) of characters.  Do not
assume that the alphabetic characters are encoded contiguously (in
the numeric sense).  Do not assume anything about the ordering of the
characters.  The lowercase letters may come before or after the
uppercase letters; the lowercase and uppercase may be interlaced so
that both `a' and `A' come before `b'; the accented and other
international characters may be interlaced so that a\*: comes
before `b'.
.Sh "Internationalisation"
.IX Subsection "Internationalisation"
If you may assume \s-1POSIX\s0 (a rather large assumption), you may read
more about the \s-1POSIX\s0 locale system from the perllocale manpage.  The locale
system at least attempts to make things a little bit more portable,
or at least more convenient and native-friendly for non-English
users.  The system affects character sets and encoding, and date
and time formatting\*(--amongst other things.
.Sh "System Resources"
.IX Subsection "System Resources"
If your code is destined for systems with severely constrained (or
missing!) virtual memory systems then you want to be \fIespecially\fR mindful
of avoiding wasteful constructs such as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # NOTE: this is no longer "bad" in perl5.005
\&    for (0..10000000) {}                       # bad
\&    for (my $x = 0; $x <= 10000000; ++$x) {}   # good
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    @lines = <VERY_LARGE_FILE>;                # bad
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    while (<FILE>) {$file .= $_}               # sometimes bad
\&    $file = join('', <FILE>);                  # better
.Ve
The last two constructs may appear unintuitive to most people.  The
first repeatedly grows a string, whereas the second allocates a
large chunk of memory in one go.  On some systems, the second is
more efficient that the first.
.Sh "Security"
.IX Subsection "Security"
Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security, usually
implemented at the filesystem level.  Some, however, do
not\*(--unfortunately.  Thus the notion of user id, or \*(L"home\*(R" directory,
or even the state of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many
platforms.  If you write programs that are security-conscious, it
is usually best to know what type of system you will be running
under so that you can write code explicitly for that platform (or
class of platforms).
.Sh "Style"
.IX Subsection "Style"
For those times when it is necessary to have platform-specific code,
consider keeping the platform-specific code in one place, making porting
to other platforms easier.  Use the Config module and the special
variable \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR to differentiate platforms, as described in
the section on "PLATFORMS".
.PP
Be careful in the tests you supply with your module or programs.
Module code may be fully portable, but its tests might not be.  This
often happens when tests spawn off other processes or call external
programs to aid in the testing, or when (as noted above) the tests
assume certain things about the filesystem and paths.  Be careful
not to depend on a specific output style for errors, such as when
checking \f(CW\*(C`$!\*(C'\fR after an system call.  Some platforms expect a certain
output format, and perl on those platforms may have been adjusted
accordingly.  Most specifically, don't anchor a regex when testing
an error value.
.SH "CPAN Testers"
.IX Header "CPAN Testers"
Modules uploaded to \s-1CPAN\s0 are tested by a variety of volunteers on
different platforms.  These \s-1CPAN\s0 testers are notified by mail of each
new upload, and reply to the list with \s-1PASS\s0, \s-1FAIL\s0, \s-1NA\s0 (not applicable to
this platform), or \s-1UNKNOWN\s0 (unknown), along with any relevant notations.
.PP
The purpose of the testing is twofold: one, to help developers fix any
problems in their code that crop up because of lack of testing on other
platforms; two, to provide users with information about whether
a given module works on a given platform.

.SH "PLATFORMS"
.IX Header "PLATFORMS"
As of version 5.002, Perl is built with a \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR variable that
indicates the operating system it was built on.  This was implemented
to help speed up code that would otherwise have to \f(CW\*(C`use Config\*(C'\fR
and use the value of \f(CW\*(C`$Config{osname}\*(C'\fR.  Of course, to get more
detailed information about the system, looking into \f(CW\*(C`%Config\*(C'\fR is
certainly recommended.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`%Config\*(C'\fR cannot always be trusted, however, because it was built
at compile time.  If perl was built in one place, then transferred
elsewhere, some values may be wrong.  The values may even have been
edited after the fact.
.Sh "Unix"
.IX Subsection "Unix"
Perl works on a bewildering variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms (see
e.g. most of the files in the \fIhints/\fR directory in the source code kit).
On most of these systems, the value of \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR (hence \f(CW\*(C`$Config{'osname'}\*(C'\fR,
too) is determined either by lowercasing and stripping punctuation from the
first field of the string returned by typing \f(CW\*(C`uname \-a\*(C'\fR (or a similar command)
at the shell prompt or by testing the file system for the presence of
uniquely named files such as a kernel or header file.  Here, for example,
are a few of the more popular Unix flavors:
.PP
.Vb 28

Because the value of \f(CW\*(C`$Config{archname}\*(C'\fR may depend on the
hardware architecture, it can vary more than the value of \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "\s-1DOS\s0 and Derivatives"
.IX Subsection "DOS and Derivatives"
Perl has long been ported to Intel-style microcomputers running under
systems like \s-1PC-DOS\s0, \s-1MS-DOS\s0, \s-1OS/2\s0, and most Windows platforms you can
bring yourself to mention (except for Windows \s-1CE\s0, if you count that).
Users familiar with \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0.COM\fR or \fI\s-1CMD\s0.EXE\fR style shells should
be aware that each of these file specifications may have subtle
differences:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $filespec0 = "c:/foo/bar/file.txt";
\&    $filespec1 = "c:\e\efoo\e\ebar\e\efile.txt";
\&    $filespec2 = 'c:\efoo\ebar\efile.txt';
\&    $filespec3 = 'c:\e\efoo\e\ebar\e\efile.txt';
.Ve
System calls accept either \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR as the path separator.
However, many command-line utilities of \s-1DOS\s0 vintage treat \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR as
the option prefix, so may get confused by filenames containing \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
Aside from calling any external programs, \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR will work just fine,
and probably better, as it is more consistent with popular usage,
and avoids the problem of remembering what to backwhack and what
not to.
.PP
The \s-1DOS\s0 \s-1FAT\s0 filesystem can accommodate only \*(L"8.3\*(R" style filenames.  Under
the \*(L"case-insensitive, but case-preserving\*(R" \s-1HPFS\s0 (\s-1OS/2\s0) and \s-1NTFS\s0 (\s-1NT\s0)
filesystems you may have to be careful about case returned with functions
like \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR or used with functions like \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`opendir\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\s-1DOS\s0 also treats several filenames as special, such as \s-1AUX\s0, \s-1PRN\s0,
\&\s-1NUL\s0, \s-1CON\s0, \s-1COM1\s0, \s-1LPT1\s0, \s-1LPT2\s0, etc.  Unfortunately, sometimes these
filenames won't even work if you include an explicit directory
prefix.  It is best to avoid such filenames, if you want your code
to be portable to \s-1DOS\s0 and its derivatives.  It's hard to know what
these all are, unfortunately.
.PP
Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of
scripts such as \fIpl2bat.bat\fR or \fIpl2cmd\fR to
put wrappers around your scripts.
.PP
Newline (\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR) is translated as \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR by \s-1STDIO\s0 when reading from
and writing to files (see the section on "Newlines").  \f(CW\*(C`binmode(FILEHANDLE)\*(C'\fR
will keep \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR translated as \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR for that filehandle.  Since it is a
no-op on other systems, \f(CW\*(C`binmode\*(C'\fR should be used for cross-platform code
that deals with binary data.  That's assuming you realize in advance
that your data is in binary.  General-purpose programs should
often assume nothing about their data.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR variable and the \f(CW\*(C`$Config{archname}\*(C'\fR values for various

.Sh "\s-1VMS\s0"
.IX Subsection "VMS"
Perl on \s-1VMS\s0 is discussed in the perlvms manpage in the perl distribution.
Perl on \s-1VMS\s0 can accept either \s-1VMS-\s0 or Unix-style file
specifications as in either of the following:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM
\&    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /sys$login/login.com
.Ve
but not a mixture of both as in:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" sys$login:/login.com
\&    Can't open sys$login:/login.com: file specification syntax error
.Ve
Interacting with Perl from the Digital Command Language (\s-1DCL\s0) shell
often requires a different set of quotation marks than Unix shells do.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ perl -e "print ""Hello, world.\en"""
\&    Hello, world.
.Ve
There are several ways to wrap your perl scripts in \s-1DCL\s0 \fI.COM\fR files, if
you are so inclined.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    $ write sys$output "Hello from DCL!"
\&    $ if p1 .eqs. ""
\&    $ then perl -x 'f$environment("PROCEDURE")
\&    $ else perl -x - 'p1 'p2 'p3 'p4 'p5 'p6 'p7 'p8
\&    $ deck/dollars="__END__"
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    print "Hello from Perl!\en";
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    __END__
\&    $ endif
.Ve
Do take care with \f(CW\*(C`$ ASSIGN/nolog/user SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT\*(C'\fR if your
perl-in-DCL script expects to do things like \f(CW\*(C`$read = <STDIN>;\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Filenames are in the format \*(L"name.extension;version\*(R".  The maximum
length for filenames is 39 characters, and the maximum length for
extensions is also 39 characters.  Version is a number from 1 to
32767.  Valid characters are \f(CW\*(C`/[A\-Z0\-9$_\-]/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\s-1VMS\s0's \s-1RMS\s0 filesystem is case-insensitive and does not preserve case.
\&\f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR returns lowercased filenames, but specifying a file for
opening remains case-insensitive.  Files without extensions have a
trailing period on them, so doing a \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR with a file named \fIA.;5\fR
will return \fIa.\fR (though that file could be opened with
\&\f(CW\*(C`open(FH, 'A')\*(C'\fR).
.PP
\&\s-1RMS\s0 had an eight level limit on directory depths from any rooted logical
(allowing 16 levels overall) prior to \s-1VMS\s0 7.2.  Hence
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]\*(C'\fR is a valid directory specification but
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]\*(C'\fR is not.  \fIMakefile.PL\fR authors might
have to take this into account, but at least they can refer to the former
as \f(CW\*(C`/PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \s-1VMS:\s0:Filespec module, which gets installed as part of the build
process on \s-1VMS\s0, is a pure Perl module that can easily be installed on
non-VMS platforms and can be helpful for conversions to and from \s-1RMS\s0
native formats.
.PP
What \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR represents depends on the type of file opened.  It could
be \f(CW\*(C`\e015\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e015\e012\*(C'\fR, or nothing.  The \s-1VMS:\s0:Stdio module
provides access to the special \fIfopen()\fR requirements of files with unusual
attributes on \s-1VMS\s0.
.PP
\&\s-1TCP/IP\s0 stacks are optional on \s-1VMS\s0, so socket routines might not be
implemented.  \s-1UDP\s0 sockets may not be supported.
.PP
The value of \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR on OpenVMS is \*(L"\s-1VMS\s0\*(R".  To determine the architecture
that you are running on without resorting to loading all of \f(CW\*(C`%Config\*(C'\fR
you can examine the content of the \f(CW\*(C`@INC\*(C'\fR array like so:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    if (grep(/VMS_AXP/, @INC)) {
\&        print "I'm on Alpha!\en";
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    } elsif (grep(/VMS_VAX/, @INC)) {
\&        print "I'm on VAX!\en";
.Ve
.Vb 3
\&    } else {
\&        print "I'm not so sure about where $^O is...\en";
\&    }
.Ve
On \s-1VMS\s0, perl determines the \s-1UTC\s0 offset from the \f(CW\*(C`SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL\*(C'\fR
logical name.  Although the \s-1VMS\s0 epoch began at 17\-NOV-1858 00:00:00.00,
calls to \f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR are adjusted to count offsets from
01\-JAN-1970 00:00:00.00, just like Unix.

.IX Subsection "VOS"
Perl on \s-1VOS\s0 is discussed in \fI\s-1README\s0.vos\fR in the perl distribution
(installed as the perlvos manpage).  Perl on \s-1VOS\s0 can accept either \s-1VOS-\s0 or
Unix-style file specifications as in either of the following:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" >system>notices
\&    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /system/notices
.Ve
or even a mixture of both as in:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" >system/notices
.Ve
Even though \s-1VOS\s0 allows the slash character to appear in object
names, because the \s-1VOS\s0 port of Perl interprets it as a pathname
delimiting character, \s-1VOS\s0 files, directories, or links whose names
contain a slash character cannot be processed.  Such files must be
renamed before they can be processed by Perl.  Note that \s-1VOS\s0 limits
file names to 32 or fewer characters.
.PP
See \fI\s-1README\s0.vos\fR for restrictions that apply when Perl is built
with the alpha version of \s-1VOS\s0 \s-1POSIX\s0.1 support.
.PP
Perl on \s-1VOS\s0 is built without any extensions and does not support
dynamic loading.
.PP
The value of \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR on \s-1VOS\s0 is \*(L"\s-1VOS\s0\*(R".  To determine the architecture that

.Sh "\s-1EBCDIC\s0 Platforms"
.IX Subsection "EBCDIC Platforms"
Recent versions of Perl have been ported to platforms such as \s-1OS/400\s0 on
\&\s-1AS/400\s0 minicomputers as well as \s-1OS/390\s0, \s-1VM/ESA\s0, and \s-1BS2000\s0 for S/390
Mainframes.  Such computers use \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character sets internally (usually
Character Code Set \s-1ID\s0 0037 for \s-1OS/400\s0 and either 1047 or \s-1POSIX-BC\s0 for S/390
systems).  On the mainframe perl currently works under the \*(L"Unix system
services for \s-1OS/390\s0\*(R" (formerly known as OpenEdition), \s-1VM/ESA\s0 OpenEdition, or
the \s-1BS200\s0 \s-1POSIX-BC\s0 system (\s-1BS2000\s0 is supported in perl 5.6 and greater).
See the perlos390 manpage for details.  
.PP
As of R2.5 of \s-1USS\s0 for \s-1OS/390\s0 and Version 2.3 of \s-1VM/ESA\s0 these Unix
sub-systems do not support the \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR shebang trick for script invocation.
Hence, on \s-1OS/390\s0 and \s-1VM/ESA\s0 perl scripts can be executed with a header
similar to the following simple script:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    : # use perl
\&        eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
\&            if 0;
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl     # just a comment really
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    print "Hello from perl!\en";
.Ve
\&\s-1OS/390\s0 will support the \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond.
Calls to \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR and backticks can use \s-1POSIX\s0 shell syntax on all
S/390 systems.
.PP
On the \s-1AS/400\s0, if \s-1PERL5\s0 is in your library list, you may need
to wrap your perl scripts in a \s-1CL\s0 procedure to invoke them like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    BEGIN
\&      CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM('/QOpenSys/hello.pl')
\&    ENDPGM
.Ve
This will invoke the perl script \fIhello.pl\fR in the root of the
QOpenSys file system.  On the \s-1AS/400\s0 calls to \f(CW\*(C`system\*(C'\fR or backticks
must use \s-1CL\s0 syntax.
.PP
On these platforms, bear in mind that the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character set may have
an effect on what happens with some perl functions (such as \f(CW\*(C`chr\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ord\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unpack\*(C'\fR), as
well as bit-fiddling with \s-1ASCII\s0 constants using operators like \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR, not to mention dealing with socket interfaces to \s-1ASCII\s0 computers
(see the section on "Newlines").
.PP
Fortunately, most web servers for the mainframe will correctly
translate the \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR in the following statement to its \s-1ASCII\s0 equivalent
(\f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR is the same under both Unix and \s-1OS/390\s0 & \s-1VM/ESA\s0):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print "Content-type: text/html\er\en\er\en";
.Ve
The values of \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR on some of these platforms includes:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    uname         $^O        $Config{'archname'}
\&    --------------------------------------------
\&    OS/390        os390      os390
\&    OS400         os400      os400
\&    POSIX-BC      posix-bc   BS2000-posix-bc
\&    VM/ESA        vmesa      vmesa
.Ve
Some simple tricks for determining if you are running on an \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platform could include any of the following (perhaps all):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    if ("\et" eq "\e05")   { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\en"; }
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    if (ord('A') == 193) { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\en"; }
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    if (chr(169) eq 'z') { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\en"; }
.Ve
One thing you may not want to rely on is the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 encoding
of punctuation characters since these may differ from code page to code
page (and once your module or script is rumoured to work with \s-1EBCDIC\s0,
folks will want it to work with all \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character sets).

.Sh "Acorn \s-1RISC\s0 \s-1OS\s0"
.IX Subsection "Acorn RISC OS"
Because Acorns use \s-1ASCII\s0 with newlines (\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR) in text files as \f(CW\*(C`\e012\*(C'\fR like
Unix, and because Unix filename emulation is turned on by default, 
most simple scripts will probably work \*(L"out of the box\*(R".  The native
filesystem is modular, and individual filesystems are free to be
case-sensitive or insensitive, and are usually case-preserving.  Some
native filesystems have name length limits, which file and directory
names are silently truncated to fit.  Scripts should be aware that the
standard filesystem currently has a name length limit of \fB10\fR
characters, with up to 77 items in a directory, but other filesystems
may not impose such limitations.
.PP
Native filenames are of the form
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Filesystem#Special_Field::DiskName.$.Directory.Directory.File
.Ve
where
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    Special_Field is not usually present, but may contain . and $ .
\&    Filesystem =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_]|
\&    DsicName   =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_/]|
\&    $ represents the root directory
\&    . is the path separator
\&    @ is the current directory (per filesystem but machine global)
\&    ^ is the parent directory
\&    Directory and File =~ m|[^\e0- "\e.\e$\e%\e&:\e@\e\e^\e|\e177]+|
.Ve
The default filename translation is roughly \f(CW\*(C`tr|/.|./|;\*(C'\fR
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`"ADFS::HardDisk.$.File" ne 'ADFS::HardDisk.$.File'\*(C'\fR and that
the second stage of \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR interpolation in regular expressions will fall
foul of the \f(CW\*(C`$.\*(C'\fR if scripts are not careful.
.PP
Logical paths specified by system variables containing comma-separated
search lists are also allowed; hence \f(CW\*(C`System:Modules\*(C'\fR is a valid
filename, and the filesystem will prefix \f(CW\*(C`Modules\*(C'\fR with each section of
\&\f(CW\*(C`System$Path\*(C'\fR until a name is made that points to an object on disk.
Writing to a new file \f(CW\*(C`System:Modules\*(C'\fR would be allowed only if
\&\f(CW\*(C`System$Path\*(C'\fR contains a single item list.  The filesystem will also
expand system variables in filenames if enclosed in angle brackets, so
\&\f(CW\*(C`<System$Dir>.Modules\*(C'\fR would look for the file
\&\f(CW\*(C`$ENV{'System$Dir'}\ .\ 'Modules'\*(C'\fR.  The obvious implication of this is
that \fBfully qualified filenames can start with \f(CB\*(C`<>\*(C'\fB\fR and should
be protected when \f(CW\*(C`open\*(C'\fR is used for input.
.PP
Because \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR was in use as a directory separator and filenames could not
be assumed to be unique after 10 characters, Acorn implemented the C
compiler to strip the trailing \f(CW\*(C`.c\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`.h\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`.s\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.o\*(C'\fR suffix from
filenames specified in source code and store the respective files in
subdirectories named after the suffix.  Hence files are translated:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    foo.h           h.foo
\&    C:foo.h         C:h.foo        (logical path variable)
\&    sys/os.h        sys.h.os       (C compiler groks Unix-speak)
\&    10charname.c    c.10charname
\&    10charname.o    o.10charname
\&    11charname_.c   c.11charname   (assuming filesystem truncates at 10)
.Ve
The Unix emulation library's translation of filenames to native assumes
that this sort of translation is required, and it allows a user-defined list
of known suffixes that it will transpose in this fashion.  This may
seem transparent, but consider that with these rules \f(CW\*(C`foo/bar/baz.h\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`foo/bar/h/baz\*(C'\fR both map to \f(CW\*(C`foo.bar.h.baz\*(C'\fR, and that \f(CW\*(C`readdir\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`glob\*(C'\fR cannot and do not attempt to emulate the reverse mapping.  Other
\&\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR's in filenames are translated to \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR.
.PP
As implied above, the environment accessed through \f(CW\*(C`%ENV\*(C'\fR is global, and
the convention is that program specific environment variables are of the
form \f(CW\*(C`Program$Name\*(C'\fR.  Each filesystem maintains a current directory,
and the current filesystem's current directory is the \fBglobal\fR current
directory.  Consequently, sociable programs don't change the current
directory but rely on full pathnames, and programs (and Makefiles) cannot
assume that they can spawn a child process which can change the current
directory without affecting its parent (and everyone else for that
matter).
.PP
Because native operating system filehandles are global and are currently 
allocated down from 255, with 0 being a reserved value, the Unix emulation
library emulates Unix filehandles.  Consequently, you can't rely on
passing \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR to your children.
.PP
The desire of users to express filenames of the form
\&\f(CW\*(C`<Foo$Dir>.Bar\*(C'\fR on the command line unquoted causes problems,
too: \f(CW\*(C```\*(C'\fR command output capture has to perform a guessing game.  It
assumes that a string \f(CW\*(C`<[^<>]+\e$[^<>]>\*(C'\fR is a
reference to an environment variable, whereas anything else involving
\&\f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR is redirection, and generally manages to be 99%
right.  Of course, the problem remains that scripts cannot rely on any
Unix tools being available, or that any tools found have Unix-like command
line arguments.
.PP
Extensions and \s-1XS\s0 are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free
tools.  In practice, many don't, as users of the Acorn platform are
used to binary distributions.  MakeMaker does run, but no available
make currently copes with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if and when
this should be fixed, the lack of a Unix-like shell will cause
problems with makefile rules, especially lines of the form \f(CW\*(C`cd
sdbm && make all\*(C'\fR, and anything using quoting.
.PP
"\s-1RISC\s0\ \s-1OS\s0" is the proper name for the operating system, but the value
in \f(CW\*(C`$^O\*(C'\fR is \*(L"riscos\*(R" (because we don't like shouting).

As of early 2001 (the Perl release 5.6.1), the following platforms are
able to build Perl from the standard source code distribution
available at http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/index.html

\&        1) in DOS mode either the DOS or OS/2 ports can be used
\&        2) Mac OS Classic (pre-X) is almost 5.6.1-ready; building from
\&           the source does work with 5.6.1, but additional MacOS specific
\&           source code is needed for a complete build.  Contact the mailing
\&           list macperl-porters@macperl.org for more information.
\&        3) compilers: Borland, Cygwin, Mingw32 EGCS/GCC, VC++
.Ve
The following platforms worked for the previous release (5.6.0),
but we did not manage to test these in time for the 5.6.1 release.
There is a very good chance that these will work fine with 5.6.1.
.PP
.Vb 15

\&        Windows 3.1
\&        Windows 95
\&        Windows 98
\&        Windows Me
.Ve
The following platform worked for the 5.005_03 major release but not
5.6.0.  Standardization on \s-1UTF-8\s0 as the internal string representation
in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 has introduced incompatibilities in this \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platform.  While Perl 5.6.1 will build on this platform some
regression tests may fail and the \f(CW\*(C`use utf8;\*(C'\fR pragma typically
introduces text handling errors.  \s-1UTF-8\s0 support for this platform may
be enabled in a future release:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        OS/390  1)
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&        1) previously known as MVS, about to become z/OS.
.Ve
Strongly related to the \s-1OS/390\s0 platform by also being EBCDIC-based
mainframe platforms are the following platforms:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        POSIX-BC        (BS2000)
\&        VM/ESA
.Ve
These are also expected to work, albeit with no \s-1UTF-8\s0 support, under 5.6.1 
for the same reasons as \s-1OS/390\s0.  Contact the mailing list perl-mvs@perl.org 
for more details.
.PP
The following platforms have been known to build Perl from source in
the past (5.005_03 and earlier), but we haven't been able to verify
their status for the current release, either because the
hardware/software platforms are rare or because we don't have an
active champion on these platforms\*(--or both.  They used to work,
though, so go ahead and try compiling them, and let perlbug@perl.org
of any trouble.

the source code, both for maximal configurability and for security,
