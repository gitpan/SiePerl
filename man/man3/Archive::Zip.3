.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create,
manipulate, read, and write Zip archive files.
.PP
Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings.
.PP
Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged,
and enumerated.
They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments,
or other attributes queried or modified.
Their data can be compressed or uncompressed as needed.
Members can be created from members in existing Zip files,
or from existing directories, files, or strings.
.PP
This module uses the Compress::Zlib library
to read and write the compressed streams inside the files.

.SH "ERROR CODES"
.IX Header "ERROR CODES"
Many of the methods in Archive::Zip return error codes.
These are implemented as inline subroutines, using the \f(CW\*(C`use constant\*(C'\fR pragma.
They can be imported into your namespace using the \f(CW\*(C`:CONSTANT\*(C'\fR
tag:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use Archive::Zip qw( :CONSTANTS );
\&    ...
\&    die "whoops!" if $zip->read( 'myfile.zip' ) != AZ_OK;
.Ve
.Ip "\s-1AZ_OK\s0 (0)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_OK (0)"
Everything is fine.
.Ip "\s-1AZ_STREAM_END\s0 (1)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_STREAM_END (1)"
The read stream (or central directory) ended normally.
.Ip "\s-1AZ_ERROR\s0 (2)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_ERROR (2)"
There was some generic kind of error.
.Ip "\s-1AZ_FORMAT_ERROR\s0 (3)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_FORMAT_ERROR (3)"
There is a format error in a \s-1ZIP\s0 file being read.
.Ip "\s-1AZ_IO_ERROR\s0 (4)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_IO_ERROR (4)"
There was an \s-1IO\s0 error.
.SH "COMPRESSION"
.IX Header "COMPRESSION"
Archive::Zip allows each member of a \s-1ZIP\s0 file to be compressed (using
the Deflate algorithm) or uncompressed. Other compression algorithms
that some versions of \s-1ZIP\s0 have been able to produce are not supported.
.PP
Each member has two compression methods: the one it's stored as (this
is always \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 for string and external file members),
and the one you desire for the member in the zip file.
These can be different, of course, so you can make a zip member that
is not compressed out of one that is, and vice versa.
You can inquire about the current compression and set
the desired compression method:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    my $member = $zip->memberNamed( 'xyz.txt' );
\&    $member->compressionMethod();    # return current compression
\&    # set to read uncompressed
\&    $member->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
\&    # set to read compressed
\&    $member->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_DEFLATED );
.Ve
There are two different compression methods:
.Ip "\s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_STORED"
file is stored (no compression)
.Ip "\s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_DEFLATED"
file is Deflated
.Sh "Compression Levels"
.IX Subsection "Compression Levels"
If a member's desiredCompressionMethod is \s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0,
you can choose different compression levels. This choice may
affect the speed of compression and decompression, as well as
the size of the compressed member data.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $member->desiredCompressionLevel( 9 );
.Ve
The levels given can be:
.Ip "0 or \s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE\s0" 4
.IX Item "0 or COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE"
This is the same as saying
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $member->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
.Ve
.Ip "1 .. 9" 4
.IX Item "1 .. 9"
1 gives the best speed and worst compression, and 9 gives the best
compression and worst speed.
.Ip "\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FASTEST\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FASTEST"
This is a synonym for level 1.
.Ip "\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_BEST_COMPRESSION\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_LEVEL_BEST_COMPRESSION"
This is a synonym for level 9.
.Ip "\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT"
This gives a good compromise between speed and compression, and is
currently equivalent to 6 (this is in the zlib code).
.Sp
This is the level that will be used if not specified.
.SH "Archive::Zip methods"
.IX Header "Archive::Zip methods"
The Archive::Zip class (and its invisible subclass Archive::Zip::Archive)
implement generic zip file functionality.
.PP
Creating a new Archive::Zip object actually makes an Archive::Zip::Archive
object, but you don't have to worry about this unless you're subclassing.
.Sh "Constructor"
.IX Subsection "Constructor"
.Ip "new( [$fileName] )" 4
.IX Item "new( [$fileName] )"
Make a new, empty zip archive.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $zip = Archive::Zip->new();
.Ve
If an additional argument is passed, \fInew()\fR will call \fIread()\fR to read the
contents of an archive:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $zip = Archive::Zip->new( 'xyz.zip' );
.Ve
If a filename argument is passed and the read fails for any reason, new
will return undef. For this reason, it may be better to call read
separately.
.Sh "Utility Methods"
.IX Subsection "Utility Methods"
These Archive::Zip methods may be called as functions or as object
methods. Do not call them as class methods:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $zip = Archive::Zip->new();
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( 'ghijkl' );    # OK
\&    $crc = $zip->computeCRC32( 'ghijkl' );            # also OK
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip->computeCRC32( 'ghijkl' );    # NOT OK
.Ve
.Ip "Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( \f(CW$string\fR [, \f(CW$crc\fR] )" 4
.IX Item "Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( $string [, $crc] )"
This is a utility function that uses the Compress::Zlib \s-1CRC\s0
routine to compute a \s-1CRC-32\s0.
.Sp
You can get the \s-1CRC\s0 of a string:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( $string );
.Ve
Or you can compute the running \s-1CRC:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $crc = 0;
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( 'abcdef', $crc );
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( 'ghijkl', $crc );
.Ve
.Ip "Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( \f(CW$number\fR )" 4
.IX Item "Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( $number )"
Change chunk size used for reading and writing.
Currently, this defaults to 32K.
This is not exportable, so you must call it like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( 4096 );
.Ve
or as a method on a zip (though this is a global setting).
Returns old chunk size.
.Ip "Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( \e&subroutine )" 4
.IX Item "Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( &subroutine )"
Change the subroutine called with error strings.
This defaults to \e&Carp::carp, but you may want to change
it to get the error strings.
.Sp
This is not exportable, so you must call it like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( \e&myErrorHandler );
.Ve
If no error handler is passed, resets handler to default.
.Sp
Returns old error handler.
.Sp
Note that if you call Carp::carp or a similar routine
or if you're chaining to the default error handler
from your error handler, you may want to increment the number
of caller levels that are skipped (do not just set it to a number):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $Carp::CarpLevel++;
.Ve
.Sh "Accessors"
.IX Subsection "Accessors"
.Ip "\fImembers()\fR" 4

.Ip "membersMatching( \f(CW$regex\fR )" 4
.IX Item "membersMatching( $regex )"
Return array of members whose filenames match given regular
expression in list context.
Returns number of matching members in scalar context.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my @textFileMembers = $zip->membersMatching( '.*\e.txt' );
\&    # or
\&    my $numberOfTextFiles = $zip->membersMatching( '.*\e.txt' );
.Ve
.Ip "\fIdiskNumber()\fR" 4
.IX Item "diskNumber()"
Return the disk that I start on.
Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip in.
This had better be 0, as Archive::Zip does not handle multi-volume archives.
.Ip "\fIdiskNumberWithStartOfCentralDirectory()\fR" 4
.IX Item "diskNumberWithStartOfCentralDirectory()"
Return the disk number that holds the beginning of the central directory.
Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip in.
This had better be 0, as Archive::Zip does not handle multi-volume archives.
.Ip "\fInumberOfCentralDirectoriesOnThisDisk()\fR" 4
.IX Item "numberOfCentralDirectoriesOnThisDisk()"
Return the number of \s-1CD\s0 structures on this disk.
Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip in.
.Ip "\fInumberOfCentralDirectories()\fR" 4
.IX Item "numberOfCentralDirectories()"
Return the number of \s-1CD\s0 structures in the whole zip.
Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip in.

Get or set the zipfile comment.
Returns the old comment.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    print $zip->zipfileComment();
\&    $zip->zipfileComment( 'New Comment' );
.Ve
.Sh "Member Operations"
.IX Subsection "Member Operations"
Various operations on a zip file modify members.
When a member is passed as an argument, you can either use a reference
to the member itself, or the name of a member. Of course, using the
name requires that names be unique within a zip (this is not enforced).
.Ip "removeMember( \f(CW$memberOrName\fR )" 4
.IX Item "removeMember( $memberOrName )"
Remove and return the given member, or match its name and remove it.
Returns undef if member name doesn't exist in this Zip.
No-op if member does not belong to this zip.
.Ip "replaceMember( \f(CW$memberOrName\fR, \f(CW$newMember\fR )" 4
.IX Item "replaceMember( $memberOrName, $newMember )"
Remove and return the given member, or match its name and remove it.
Replace with new member.
Returns undef if member name doesn't exist in this Zip.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    my $member1 = $zip->removeMember( 'xyz' );
\&    my $member2 = $zip->replaceMember( 'abc', $member1 );

.Ve
.Ip "extractMember( \f(CW$memberOrName\fR [, \f(CW$extractedName\fR ] )" 4
.IX Item "extractMember( $memberOrName [, $extractedName ] )"
Extract the given member, or match its name and extract it.
Returns undef if member doesn't exist in this Zip.
If optional second arg is given, use it as the name of the
extracted member. Otherwise, the internal filename of the member is used
as the name of the extracted file or directory.
.Sp
All necessary directories will be created.
.Sp
Returns \f(CW\*(C`AZ_OK\*(C'\fR on success.
.Ip "extractMemberWithoutPaths( \f(CW$memberOrName\fR [, \f(CW$extractedName\fR ] )" 4
.IX Item "extractMemberWithoutPaths( $memberOrName [, $extractedName ] )"
Extract the given member, or match its name and extract it.
Does not use path information (extracts into the current directory).
Returns undef if member doesn't exist in this Zip.
If optional second arg is given, use it as the name of the
extracted member (its paths will be deleted too).
Otherwise, the internal filename of the member (minus paths) is used
as the name of the extracted file or directory.
.Sp
Returns \f(CW\*(C`AZ_OK\*(C'\fR on success.
.Ip "addMember( \f(CW$member\fR )" 4
.IX Item "addMember( $member )"
Append a member (possibly from another zip file) to the zip file.
Returns the new member.
Generally, you will use \fIaddFile()\fR, \fIaddDirectory()\fR, \fIaddString()\fR, or \fIread()\fR
to add members.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    # Move member named 'abc' to end of zip:

\&    $zip->addMember( $member );
.Ve
.Ip "addFile( \f(CW$fileName\fR [, \f(CW$newName\fR ] )" 4
.IX Item "addFile( $fileName [, $newName ] )"
Append a member whose data comes from an external file,
returning the member or undef.
The member will have its file name set to the name of the external
file, and its desiredCompressionMethod set to \s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0.
The file attributes and last modification time will be set from the file.
.Sp
If the name given does not represent a readable plain file or symbolic link,
undef will be returned.
.Sp
The text mode bit will be set if the contents appears to be text (as returned
by the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR perl operator).
.Sp
The optional second argument sets the internal file name to
something different than the given \f(CW$fileName\fR.
.Ip "addString( \f(CW$stringOrStringRef\fR [, \f(CW$name\fR] )" 4
.IX Item "addString( $stringOrStringRef [, $name] )"
Append a member created from the given string or string reference.

.Ip "addDirectory( \f(CW$directoryName\fR [, \f(CW$fileName\fR ] )" 4
.IX Item "addDirectory( $directoryName [, $fileName ] )"
Append a member created from the given directory name.
The directory name does not have to name an existing directory.
If the named directory exists, the file modification time and permissions
are set from the existing directory, otherwise they are set to now and
permissive default permissions.
The optional second argument sets the name of the archive member
(which defaults to \f(CW$directoryName\fR)
.Sp
Returns the new member.
.Ip "contents( \f(CW$memberOrMemberName\fR [, \f(CW$newContents\fR ] )" 4

.Ip "writeToFileNamed( \f(CW$fileName\fR )" 4
.IX Item "writeToFileNamed( $fileName )"
Write a zip archive to named file.
Returns \f(CW\*(C`AZ_OK\*(C'\fR on success.
.Sp
Note that if you use the same name as an existing
zip file that you read in, you will clobber ZipFileMembers.
So instead, write to a different file name, then delete
the original.

.IX Item "writeToFileHandle( $fileHandle [, $seekable] )"
Write a zip archive to a file handle.
Return \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success.
.Sp
The optional second arg tells whether or not to try to seek backwards
to re-write headers.
If not provided, it is set by testing seekability. This could fail
on some operating systems, though.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $fh = IO::File->new( 'someFile.zip', 'w' );

.Ve
If you pass a file handle that is not seekable (like if you're writing
to a pipe or a socket), pass a false as the second argument:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $fh = IO::File->new( '| cat > somefile.zip', 'w' );

This is where the \f(CW\*(C`GPBF_*\*(C'\fR bits live.
.Ip "\fIcompressionMethod()\fR" 4
.IX Item "compressionMethod()"
Returns my compression method. This is the method that is
currently being used to compress my data.
.Sp
This will be \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 for added string or file members,
or any of the \f(CW\*(C`COMPRESSION_*\*(C'\fR values for members from a zip file.
However, this module can only handle members whose data is in
\&\s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 or \s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0 format.
.Ip "desiredCompressionMethod( [$method] )" 4
.IX Item "desiredCompressionMethod( [$method] )"
Get or set my desiredCompressionMethod
This is the method that will be used to write.
Returns prior desiredCompressionMethod.
.Sp
Only \s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0 or \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 are valid arguments.
.Sp
Changing to \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 will change my desiredCompressionLevel
to 0; changing to \s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0 will change my
desiredCompressionLevel to \s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT\s0.
.Ip "desiredCompressionLevel( [$method] )" 4

Returns old attributes.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $oldAttribs = $member->unixFileAttributes( 0666 );
.Ve
Note that the return value has more than just the file permissions,
so you will have to mask off the lowest bits for comparisions.
.Ip "localExtraField( [$newField] )" 4
.IX Item "localExtraField( [$newField] )"
Gets or sets the extra field that was read from the local header.
This is not set for a member from a zip file until after the

Get or set the member's file comment.
.Ip "\fIhasDataDescriptor()\fR" 4
.IX Item "hasDataDescriptor()"
Get or set the data descriptor flag.
If this is set, the local header will not necessarily
have the correct data sizes. Instead, a small structure
will be stored at the end of the member data with these
values.
.Sp
This should be transparent in normal operation.
.Ip "\fIcrc32()\fR" 4
.IX Item "crc32()"
Return the \s-1CRC-32\s0 value for this member.

.IX Item "isDirectory()"
Returns true if I am a directory.
.Sh "Low-level member data reading"
.IX Subsection "Low-level member data reading"
It is possible to use lower-level routines to access member
data streams, rather than the extract* methods and \fIcontents()\fR.
.PP
For instance, here is how to print the uncompressed contents
of a member in chunks using these methods:
.PP
.Vb 13
\&    my ( $member, $status, $bufferRef );
\&    $member = $zip->memberNamed( 'xyz.txt' );
\&    $member->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );

\&    {
\&        ( $bufferRef, $status ) = $member->readChunk();
\&        die "error $status" if $status != AZ_OK;
\&        # do something with $bufferRef:
\&        print $$bufferRef;
\&    }
\&    $member->endRead();
.Ve
.Ip "readChunk( [$chunkSize] )" 4
.IX Item "readChunk( [$chunkSize] )"
This reads the next chunk of given size from the member's data stream and
compresses or uncompresses it as necessary, returning a reference to the bytes
read and a status.
If size argument is not given, defaults to global set by
Archive::Zip::setChunkSize.
Status is \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success. Returns \f(CW\*(C`( \e$bytes, $status)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my ( $outRef, $status ) = $self->readChunk();
\&    print $$outRef if $status != AZ_OK;
.Ve
.Ip "\fIrewindData()\fR" 4
.IX Item "rewindData()"
Rewind data and set up for reading data streams or writing zip files.
Can take options for \f(CW\*(C`inflateInit()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`deflateInit()\*(C'\fR,
but this isn't likely to be necessary.
Subclass overrides should call this method.
Returns \f(CW\*(C`AZ_OK\*(C'\fR on success.
.Ip "\fIendRead()\fR" 4
.IX Item "endRead()"
Reset the read variables and free the inflater or deflater.
Must be called to close files, etc.
.Sp
Returns \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success.
.Ip "\fIreadIsDone()\fR" 4
.IX Item "readIsDone()"
Return true if the read has run out of data or errored out.
.Ip "\fIcontents()\fR" 4
.IX Item "contents()"
Return the entire uncompressed member data or undef in scalar context.
When called in array context, returns \f(CW\*(C`( $string, $status )\*(C'\fR; status
will be \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    my $string = $member->contents();
\&    # or
\&    my ( $string, $status ) = $member->contents();
\&    die "error $status" if $status != AZ_OK;
.Ve
Can also be used to set the contents of a member (this may change
the class of the member):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $member->contents( "this is my new contents" );
.Ve
.Ip "extractToFileHandle( \f(CW$fh\fR )" 4
.IX Item "extractToFileHandle( $fh )"
Extract (and uncompress, if necessary) my contents to the given file handle.
Return \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success.
