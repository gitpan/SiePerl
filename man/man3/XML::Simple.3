.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    my $ref = XMLin([<xml file or string>] [, <options>]);
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    my $xml = XMLout($hashref [, <options>]);
.Ve
Or the object oriented way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    require XML::Simple;
.Ve
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Vb 1

.SH "QUICK START"
.IX Header "QUICK START"
Say you have a script called \fBfoo\fR and a file of configuration options
called \fBfoo.xml\fR containing this:
.PP
.Vb 13
\&  <config logdir="/var/log/foo/" debugfile="/tmp/foo.debug">
\&    <server name="sahara" osname="solaris" osversion="2.6">
\&      <address>10.0.0.101</address>
\&      <address>10.0.1.101</address>
\&    </server>
\&    <server name="gobi" osname="irix" osversion="6.5">
\&      <address>10.0.0.102</address>
\&    </server>
\&    <server name="kalahari" osname="linux" osversion="2.0.34">
\&      <address>10.0.0.103</address>
\&      <address>10.0.1.103</address>
\&    </server>
\&  </config>
.Ve
The following lines of code in \fBfoo\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use XML::Simple;
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&  my $config = XMLin();
.Ve
will 'slurp' the configuration options into the hashref \f(CW$config\fR (because no
arguments are passed to \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR the name and location of the \s-1XML\s0 file will
be inferred from name and location of the script).  You can dump out the
contents of the hashref using Data::Dumper:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Dumper;
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&  print Dumper($config);
.Ve
which will produce something like this (formatting has been adjusted for
brevity):
.PP
.Vb 21
\&  {
\&      'logdir'        => '/var/log/foo/',
\&      'debugfile'     => '/tmp/foo.debug',
\&      'server'        => {
\&          'sahara'        => {
\&              'osversion'     => '2.6',
\&              'osname'        => 'solaris',
\&              'address'       => [ '10.0.0.101', '10.0.1.101' ]
\&          },
\&          'gobi'          => {
\&              'osversion'     => '6.5',
\&              'osname'        => 'irix',
\&              'address'       => '10.0.0.102'
\&          },
\&          'kalahari'      => {
\&              'osversion'     => '2.0.34',
\&              'osname'        => 'linux',
\&              'address'       => [ '10.0.0.103', '10.0.1.103' ]
\&          }
\&      }
\&  }
.Ve
Your script could then access the name of the log directory like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print $config->{logdir};
.Ve
similarly, the second address on the server 'kalahari' could be referenced as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print $config->{server}->{kalahari}->{address}->[1];
.Ve
What could be simpler?  (Rhetorical).
.PP
For simple requirements, that's really all there is to it.  If you want to
store your \s-1XML\s0 in a different directory or file, or pass it in as a string or
even pass it in via some derivative of an \s-1IO:\s0:Handle, you'll need to check out
the section on "OPTIONS".  If you want to turn off or tweak the array folding feature (that
neat little transformation that produced \f(CW$config\fR->{server}) you'll find options
for that as well.
.PP
If you want to generate \s-1XML\s0 (for example to write a modified version of
\&\f(CW$config\fR back out as \s-1XML\s0), check out \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If your needs are not so simple, this may not be the module for you.  In that
case, you might want to read the section on "WHERE TO FROM HERE?".
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1XML:\s0:Simple module provides a simple \s-1API\s0 layer on top of the \s-1XML:\s0:Parser
module.  Two functions are exported: \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The most common approach is to simply call these two functions directly, but an
optional object oriented interface (see the section on "OPTIONAL OO INTERFACE" below)
allows them to be called as methods of an \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR object.
.Sh "\fIXMLin()\fP"
.IX Subsection "XMLin()"
Parses \s-1XML\s0 formatted data and returns a reference to a data structure which
contains the same information in a more readily accessible form.  (Skip
down to the section on "EXAMPLES" below, for more sample code).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR accepts an optional \s-1XML\s0 specifier followed by zero or more 'name =>
value' option pairs.  The \s-1XML\s0 specifier can be one of the following:
.Ip "A filename" 4
.IX Item "A filename"
If the filename contains no directory components \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR will look for the
file in each directory in the searchpath (see the section on "OPTIONS" below).  eg:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $ref = XMLin('/etc/params.xml');
.Ve
Note, the filename '\-' can be used to parse from \s-1STDIN\s0.
.Ip "undef" 4
.IX Item "undef"
If there is no \s-1XML\s0 specifier, \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR will check the script directory and
each of the searchpath directories for a file with the same name as the script
but with the extension '.xml'.  Note: if you wish to specify options, you
must specify the value 'undef'.  eg:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $ref = XMLin(undef, forcearray => 1);
.Ve
.Ip "A string of \s-1XML\s0" 4
.IX Item "A string of XML"
A string containing \s-1XML\s0 (recognised by the presence of '<' and '>' characters)
will be parsed directly.  eg:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $ref = XMLin('<opt username="bob" password="flurp" />');
.Ve
.Ip "An \s-1IO:\s0:Handle object" 4
.IX Item "An IO::Handle object"
An \s-1IO:\s0:Handle object will be read to \s-1EOF\s0 and its contents parsed. eg:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  $fh = new IO::File('/etc/params.xml');
\&  $ref = XMLin($fh);
.Ve
.Sh "\fIXMLout()\fP"
.IX Subsection "XMLout()"
Takes a data structure (generally a hashref) and returns an \s-1XML\s0 encoding of
that structure.  If the resulting \s-1XML\s0 is parsed using \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR, it will
return a data structure equivalent to the original. 
.PP
When translating hashes to \s-1XML\s0, hash keys which have a leading '\-' will be
silently skipped.  This is the approved method for marking elements of a
data structure which should be ignored by \f(CW\*(C`XMLout\*(C'\fR.  (Note: If these items
were not skipped the key names would be emitted as element or attribute names
with a leading '\-' which would not be valid \s-1XML\s0).
.Sh "Caveats"
.IX Subsection "Caveats"
Some care is required in creating data structures which will be passed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR.  Hash keys from the data structure will be encoded as either \s-1XML\s0
element names or attribute names.  Therefore, you should use hash key names 
which conform to the relatively strict \s-1XML\s0 naming rules:
.PP
Names in \s-1XML\s0 must begin with a letter.  The remaining characters may be
letters, digits, hyphens (\-), underscores (_) or full stops (.).  It is also
allowable to include one colon (:) in an element name but this should only be
used when working with namespaces \- a facility well beyond the scope of
\&\fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR.
.PP
You can use other punctuation characters in hash values (just not in hash
keys) however \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR does not support dumping binary data.
.PP
If you break these rules, the current implementation of \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR will 
simply emit non-compliant \s-1XML\s0 which will be rejected if you try to read it
back in.  (A later version of \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR might take a more proactive
approach).
.PP
Note also that although you can nest hashes and arrays to arbitrary levels,
recursive data structures are not supported and will cause \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR to die.
.PP
Refer to the section on "WHERE TO FROM HERE?" if \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR is too simple for your needs.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
\&\fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR supports a number of options (in fact as each release of
\&\fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR adds more options, the module's claim to the name 'Simple'
becomes more tenuous).  If you find yourself repeatedly having to specify
the same options, you might like to investigate the section on "OPTIONAL OO INTERFACE"
below.
.PP
Because there are so many options, it's hard for new users to know which ones
are important, so here are the two you really need to know about:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
check out 'forcearray' because you'll almost certainly want to turn it on
.Ip "\(bu" 4
make sure you know what the 'keyattr' option does and what its default value
is because it may surprise you otherwise
.PP
Both \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR expect a single argument followed by a list of
options.  An option takes the form of a 'name => value' pair.  The options
listed below are marked with '\fBin\fR' if they are recognised by \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR and
\&'\fBout\fR' if they are recognised by \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "keyattr => [ list ] (\fBin+out\fR)" 4
.IX Item "keyattr => [ list ] (in+out)"
This option controls the 'array folding' feature which translates nested
elements from an array to a hash.  For example, this \s-1XML:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    <opt>
\&      <user login="grep" fullname="Gary R Epstein" />
\&      <user login="stty" fullname="Simon T Tyson" />
\&    </opt>
.Ve
would, by default, parse to this:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&    {
\&      'user' => [
\&                  {
\&                    'login' => 'grep',
\&                    'fullname' => 'Gary R Epstein'
\&                  },
\&                  {
\&                    'login' => 'stty',
\&                    'fullname' => 'Simon T Tyson'
\&                  }
\&                ]
\&    }
.Ve
If the option 'keyattr => \*(L"login\*(R"' were used to specify that the 'login'
attribute is a key, the same \s-1XML\s0 would parse to:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    {
\&      'user' => {
\&                  'stty' => {
\&                              'fullname' => 'Simon T Tyson'
\&                            },
\&                  'grep' => {
\&                              'fullname' => 'Gary R Epstein'
\&                            }
\&                }
\&    }
.Ve
The key attribute names should be supplied in an arrayref if there is more
than one.  \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR will attempt to match attribute names in the order
supplied.  \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR will use the first attribute name supplied when
\&'unfolding' a hash into an array.
.Sp
Note: the keyattr option controls the folding of arrays.  By default a single
nested element will be rolled up into a scalar rather than an array and
therefore will not be folded.  Use the 'forcearray' option (below) to force
nested elements to be parsed into arrays and therefore candidates for folding
into hashes.
.Sp
The default value for 'keyattr' is ['name', 'key', 'id'].  Setting this option
to an empty list will disable the array folding feature.
.Ip "keyattr => { list } (\fBin+out\fR)" 4
.IX Item "keyattr => { list } (in+out)"
This alternative method of specifiying the key attributes allows more fine
grained control over which elements are folded and on which attributes.  For
example the option 'keyattr => { package => 'id' } will cause any package
elements to be folded on the 'id' attribute.  No other elements which have an
\&'id' attribute will be folded at all. 
.Sp
Note: \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR will generate a warning if this syntax is used and an element
which does not have the specified key attribute is encountered (eg: a 'package'
element without an 'id' attribute, to use the example above).  Warnings will
only be generated if \fB\-w\fR is in force.
.Sp
Two further variations are made possible by prefixing a '+' or a '\-' character
to the attribute name:
.Sp
The option 'keyattr => { user => \*(L"+login\*(R" }' will cause this \s-1XML:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    <opt>
\&      <user login="grep" fullname="Gary R Epstein" />
\&      <user login="stty" fullname="Simon T Tyson" />
\&    </opt>
.Ve
to parse to this data structure:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&    {
\&      'user' => {
\&                  'stty' => {
\&                              'fullname' => 'Simon T Tyson',
\&                              'login'    => 'stty'
\&                            },
\&                  'grep' => {
\&                              'fullname' => 'Gary R Epstein',
\&                              'login'    => 'grep'
\&                            }
\&                }
\&    }
.Ve
The '+' indicates that the value of the key attribute should be copied rather than
moved to the folded hash key.
.Sp
A '\-' prefix would produce this result:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&    {
\&      'user' => {
\&                  'stty' => {
\&                              'fullname' => 'Simon T Tyson',
\&                              '-login'    => 'stty'
\&                            },
\&                  'grep' => {
\&                              'fullname' => 'Gary R Epstein',
\&                              '-login'    => 'grep'
\&                            }
\&                }
\&    }
.Ve
As described earlier, \f(CW\*(C`XMLout\*(C'\fR will ignore hash keys starting with a '\-'.
.Ip "searchpath => [ list ] (\fBin\fR)" 4
.IX Item "searchpath => [ list ] (in)"
Where the \s-1XML\s0 is being read from a file, and no path to the file is specified,
this attribute allows you to specify which directories should be searched.
.Sp
If the first parameter to \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR is undefined, the default searchpath
will contain only the directory in which the script itself is located.
Otherwise the default searchpath will be empty.  
.Sp
Note: the current directory ('.') is \fBnot\fR searched unless it is the directory
containing the script.
.Ip "forcearray => 1 (\fBin\fR)" 4
.IX Item "forcearray => 1 (in)"
This option should be set to '1' to force nested elements to be represented
as arrays even when there is only one.  Eg, with forcearray enabled, this
\&\s-1XML:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    <opt>
\&      <name>value</name>
\&    </opt>
.Ve
would parse to this:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    {
\&      'name' => [
\&                  'value'
\&                ]
\&    }
.Ve
instead of this (the default):
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    {
\&      'name' => 'value'
\&    }
.Ve
This option is especially useful if the data structure is likely to be written
back out as \s-1XML\s0 and the default behaviour of rolling single nested elements up
into attributes is not desirable. 
.Sp
If you are using the array folding feature, you should almost certainly enable
this option.  If you do not, single nested elements will not be parsed to
arrays and therefore will not be candidates for folding to a hash.  (Given that
the default value of 'keyattr' enables array folding, the default value of this
option should probably also have been enabled too \- sorry).
.Ip "forcearray => [ \fIname\fR\|(s) ] (\fBin\fR)" 4
.IX Item "forcearray => [ name ] (in)"
This alternative form of the 'forcearray' option allows you to specify a list
of element names which should always be forced into an array representation,
rather than the 'all or nothing' approach above.
.Ip "noattr => 1 (\fBin+out\fR)" 4
.IX Item "noattr => 1 (in+out)"
When used with \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR, the generated \s-1XML\s0 will contain no attributes.
All hash key/values will be represented as nested elements instead.
.Sp
When used with \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR, any attributes in the \s-1XML\s0 will be ignored.
.Ip "suppressempty => 1 | '' | undef (\fBin\fR)" 4
.IX Item "suppressempty => 1 | '' | undef (in)"
This option controls what \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR should do with empty elements (no
attributes and no content).  The default behaviour is to represent them as
empty hashes.  Setting this option to a true value (eg: 1) will cause empty
elements to be skipped altogether.  Setting the option to 'undef' or the empty
string will cause empty elements to be represented as the undefined value or
the empty string respectively.  The latter two alternatives are a little
easier to test for in your code than a hash with no keys.
.Ip "cache => [ cache \fIscheme\fR\|(s) ] (\fBin\fR)" 4
.IX Item "cache => [ cache scheme ] (in)"
Because loading the \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Parser\fR module and parsing an \s-1XML\s0 file can consume a
significant number of \s-1CPU\s0 cycles, it is often desirable to cache the output of
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR for later reuse.
.Sp
When parsing from a named file, \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR supports a number of caching
schemes.  The 'cache' option may be used to specify one or more schemes (using
an anonymous array).  Each scheme will be tried in turn in the hope of finding
a cached pre-parsed representation of the \s-1XML\s0 file.  If no cached copy is
found, the file will be parsed and the first cache scheme in the list will be
used to save a copy of the results.  The following cache schemes have been
implemented:
.RS 4
.Ip "storable" 4
.IX Item "storable"
Utilises \fBStorable.pm\fR to read/write a cache file with the same name as the
\&\s-1XML\s0 file but with the extension .stor
.Ip "memshare" 4
.IX Item "memshare"
When a file is first parsed, a copy of the resulting data structure is retained
in memory in the \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR module's namespace.  Subsequent calls to parse
the same file will return a reference to this structure.  This cached version
will persist only for the life of the Perl interpreter (which in the case of
mod_perl for example, may be some significant time).
.Sp
Because each caller receives a reference to the same data structure, a change
made by one caller will be visible to all.  For this reason, the reference
returned should be treated as read-only.
.Ip "memcopy" 4
.IX Item "memcopy"
This scheme works identically to 'memshare' (above) except that each caller
receives a reference to a new data structure which is a copy of the cached
version.  Copying the data structure will add a little processing overhead,
therefore this scheme should only be used where the caller intends to modify
the data structure (or wishes to protect itself from others who might).  This
scheme uses \fBStorable.pm\fR to perform the copy.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.Ip "keeproot => 1 (\fBin+out\fR)" 4
.IX Item "keeproot => 1 (in+out)"
In its attempt to return a data structure free of superfluous detail and
unnecessary levels of indirection, \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR normally discards the root
element name.  Setting the 'keeproot' option to '1' will cause the root element
name to be retained.  So after executing this code:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $config = XMLin('<config tempdir="/tmp" />', keeproot => 1)
.Ve
You'll be able to reference the tempdir as
\&\f(CW\*(C`$config\->{config}\->{tempdir}\*(C'\fR instead of the default
\&\f(CW\*(C`$config\->{tempdir}\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Similarly, setting the 'keeproot' option to '1' will tell \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR that the
data structure already contains a root element name and it is not necessary to
add another.
.Ip "rootname => 'string' (\fBout\fR)" 4
.IX Item "rootname => 'string' (out)"
By default, when \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR generates \s-1XML\s0, the root element will be named
\&'opt'.  This option allows you to specify an alternative name.
.Sp
Specifying either undef or the empty string for the rootname option will
produce \s-1XML\s0 with no root elements.  In most cases the resulting \s-1XML\s0 fragment
will not be 'well formed' and therefore could not be read back in by \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR.
Nevertheless, the option has been found to be useful in certain circumstances.
.Ip "forcecontent (\fBin\fR)" 4
.IX Item "forcecontent (in)"
When \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR parses elements which have text content as well as attributes,
the text content must be represented as a hash value rather than a simple
scalar.  This option allows you to force text content to always parse to
a hash value even when there are no attributes.  So for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  XMLin('<opt><x>text1</x><y a="2">text2</y></opt>', forcecontent => 1)
.Ve
will parse to:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  {
\&    'x' => {           'content' => 'text1' },
\&    'y' => { 'a' => 2, 'content' => 'text2' }
\&  }
.Ve
instead of:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  {
\&    'x' => 'text1',
\&    'y' => { 'a' => 2, 'content' => 'text2' }
\&  }
.Ve
.Ip "contentkey => 'keyname' (\fBin+out\fR)" 4
.IX Item "contentkey => 'keyname' (in+out)"
When text content is parsed to a hash value, this option let's you specify a
name for the hash key to override the default 'content'.  So for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  XMLin('<opt one="1">Text</opt>', contentkey => 'text')
.Ve
will parse to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  { 'one' => 1, 'text' => 'Text' }
.Ve
instead of:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  { 'one' => 1, 'content' => 'Text' }
.Ve
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR will also honour the value of this option when converting a hashref
to \s-1XML\s0.
.Ip "xmldecl => 1  or  xmldecl => 'string'  (\fBout\fR)" 4
.IX Item "xmldecl => 1  or  xmldecl => 'string'  (out)"
If you want the output from \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR to start with the optional \s-1XML\s0
declaration, simply set the option to '1'.  The default \s-1XML\s0 declaration is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        <?xml version='1' standalone='yes'?>
.Ve
If you want some other string (for example to declare an encoding value), set
the value of this option to the complete string you require.
.Ip "outputfile => <file specifier> (\fBout\fR)" 4
.IX Item "outputfile => <file specifier> (out)"
The default behaviour of \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR is to return the \s-1XML\s0 as a string.  If you
wish to write the \s-1XML\s0 to a file, simply supply the filename using the
\&'outputfile' option.  Alternatively, you can supply an \s-1IO\s0 handle object instead
of a filename.
.Ip "noescape => 1 (\fBout\fR)" 4
.IX Item "noescape => 1 (out)"
By default, \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR will translate the characters '<', '>', '&' and
\&'"' to '&lt;', '&gt;', '&amp;' and '&quot' respectively.  Use this option to
suppress escaping (presumably because you've already escaped the data in some
more sophisticated manner).
.Ip "parseropts => [ \s-1XML:\s0:Parser Options ] (\fBin\fR)" 4
.IX Item "parseropts => [ XML::Parser Options ] (in)"
Use this option to specify parameters that should be passed to the constructor
of the underlying \s-1XML:\s0:Parser object.  For example to turn on the namespace processing mode, you could say:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  XMLin($xml, parseropts => [ Namespaces => 1 ])
.Ve
.SH "OPTIONAL OO INTERFACE"
.IX Header "OPTIONAL OO INTERFACE"
The procedural interface is both simple and convenient however there are a
couple of reasons why you might prefer to use the object oriented (\s-1OO\s0)
interface:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
to define a set of default values which should be used on all subsequent calls
to \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR
.Ip "\(bu" 4
to override methods in \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR to provide customised behaviour
.PP
The default values for the options described above are unlikely to suit
everyone.  The \s-1OO\s0 interface allows you to effectively override \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR's
defaults with your preferred values.  It works like this:
.PP
First create an \s-1XML:\s0:Simple parser object with your preferred defaults:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  my $xs = new XML::Simple(forcearray => 1, keeproot => 1);
.Ve
then call \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR as a method of that object:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $ref = $xs->XMLin($xml);
\&  my $xml = $xs->XMLout($ref);
.Ve
You can also specify options when you make the method calls and these values
will be merged with the values specified when the object was created.  Values
specified in a method call take precedence.
.PP
Overriding methods is a more advanced topic but might be useful if for example
you wished to provide an alternative routine for escaping character data (the
escape_value method) or for building the initial parse tree (the build_tree
method).
.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
.IX Header "ERROR HANDLING"
The \s-1XML\s0 standard is very clear on the issue of non-compliant documents.  An
error in parsing any single element (for example a missing end tag) must cause
the whole document to be rejected.  \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR will die with an
appropriate message if it encounters a parsing error.
.PP
If dying is not appropriate for your application, you should arrange to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR in an eval block and look for errors in $@.  eg:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $config = eval { XMLin() };
\&    PopUpMessage($@) if($@);
.Ve
Note, there is a common misconception that use of \fBeval\fR will significantly
slow down a script.  While that may be true when the code being eval'd is in a
string, it is not true of code like the sample above.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
When \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR reads the following very simple piece of \s-1XML:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    <opt username="testuser" password="frodo"></opt>
.Ve
it returns the following data structure:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    {
\&      'username' => 'testuser',
\&      'password' => 'frodo'
\&    }
.Ve
The identical result could have been produced with this alternative \s-1XML:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    <opt username="testuser" password="frodo" />
.Ve
Or this (although see 'forcearray' option for variations):
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    <opt>
\&      <username>testuser</username>
\&      <password>frodo</password>
\&    </opt>
.Ve
Repeated nested elements are represented as anonymous arrays:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    <opt>
\&      <person firstname="Joe" lastname="Smith">
\&        <email>joe@smith.com</email>
\&        <email>jsmith@yahoo.com</email>
\&      </person>
\&      <person firstname="Bob" lastname="Smith">
\&        <email>bob@smith.com</email>
\&      </person>
\&    </opt>
.Ve
.Vb 17
\&    {
\&      'person' => [
\&                    {
\&                      'email' => [
\&                                   'joe@smith.com',
\&                                   'jsmith@yahoo.com'
\&                                 ],
\&                      'firstname' => 'Joe',
\&                      'lastname' => 'Smith'
\&                    },
\&                    {
\&                      'email' => 'bob@smith.com',
\&                      'firstname' => 'Bob',
\&                      'lastname' => 'Smith'
\&                    }
\&                  ]
\&    }
.Ve
Nested elements with a recognised key attribute are transformed (folded) from
an array into a hash keyed on the value of that attribute:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    <opt>
\&      <person key="jsmith" firstname="Joe" lastname="Smith" />
\&      <person key="tsmith" firstname="Tom" lastname="Smith" />
\&      <person key="jbloggs" firstname="Joe" lastname="Bloggs" />
\&    </opt>
.Ve
.Vb 16
\&    {
\&      'person' => {
\&                    'jbloggs' => {
\&                                   'firstname' => 'Joe',
\&                                   'lastname' => 'Bloggs'
\&                                 },
\&                    'tsmith' => {
\&                                  'firstname' => 'Tom',
\&                                  'lastname' => 'Smith'
\&                                },
\&                    'jsmith' => {
\&                                  'firstname' => 'Joe',
\&                                  'lastname' => 'Smith'
\&                                }
\&                  }
\&    }
.Ve
The <anon> tag can be used to form anonymous arrays:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    <opt>
\&      <head><anon>Col 1</anon><anon>Col 2</anon><anon>Col 3</anon></head>
\&      <data><anon>R1C1</anon><anon>R1C2</anon><anon>R1C3</anon></data>
\&      <data><anon>R2C1</anon><anon>R2C2</anon><anon>R2C3</anon></data>
\&      <data><anon>R3C1</anon><anon>R3C2</anon><anon>R3C3</anon></data>
\&    </opt>
.Ve
.Vb 10
\&    {
\&      'head' => [
\&                  [ 'Col 1', 'Col 2', 'Col 3' ]
\&                ],
\&      'data' => [
\&                  [ 'R1C1', 'R1C2', 'R1C3' ],
\&                  [ 'R2C1', 'R2C2', 'R2C3' ],
\&                  [ 'R3C1', 'R3C2', 'R3C3' ]
\&                ]
\&    }
.Ve
Anonymous arrays can be nested to arbirtrary levels and as a special case, if
the surrounding tags for an \s-1XML\s0 document contain only an anonymous array the
arrayref will be returned directly rather than the usual hashref:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    <opt>
\&      <anon><anon>Col 1</anon><anon>Col 2</anon></anon>
\&      <anon><anon>R1C1</anon><anon>R1C2</anon></anon>
\&      <anon><anon>R2C1</anon><anon>R2C2</anon></anon>
\&    </opt>
.Ve
.Vb 5
\&    [
\&      [ 'Col 1', 'Col 2' ],
\&      [ 'R1C1', 'R1C2' ],
\&      [ 'R2C1', 'R2C2' ]
\&    ]
.Ve
Elements which only contain text content will simply be represented as a
scalar.  Where an element has both attributes and text content, the element
will be represented as a hashref with the text content in the 'content' key:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  <opt>
\&    <one>first</one>
\&    <two attr="value">second</two>
\&  </opt>
.Ve
.Vb 4
\&  {
\&    'one' => 'first',
\&    'two' => { 'attr' => 'value', 'content' => 'second' }
\&  }
.Ve
Mixed content (elements which contain both text content and nested elements)
will be not be represented in a useful way \- element order and significant
whitespace will be lost.  If you need to work with mixed content, then
\&\s-1XML:\s0:Simple is not the right tool for your job \- check out the next section.
.SH "WHERE TO FROM HERE?"
.IX Header "WHERE TO FROM HERE?"
\&\fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR is by nature very simple.  
.Ip "\(bu" 4
The parsing process liberally disposes of 'surplus' whitespace \- some 
applications will be sensitive to this.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Slurping data into a hash will implicitly discard information about attribute
order.  Normally this would not be a problem because any items for which order
is important would typically be encoded as elements rather than attributes.
However \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR's aggressive slurping and folding algorithms can
defeat even these techniques.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
The \s-1API\s0 offers little control over the output of \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR.  In particular,
it is not especially likely that feeding the output from \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR into
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR will reproduce the original \s-1XML\s0 (although passing the output from
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR into \f(CW\*(C`XMLin()\*(C'\fR should reproduce the original data structure).
.Ip "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR cannot produce well formed \s-1HTML\s0 unless you feed it with care \- hash
keys must conform to \s-1XML\s0 element naming rules and undefined values should be
avoided.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR does not currently support encodings (although it shouldn't stand
in your way if you feed it encoded data).
.Ip "\(bu" 4
If you're attempting to get the output from \f(CW\*(C`XMLout()\*(C'\fR to conform to a
specific \s-1DTD\s0, you're almost certainly using the wrong tool for the job.
.PP
If any of these points are a problem for you, then \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR is probably
not the right module for your application.  The following section is intended
to give pointers which might help you select a more powerful tool \- it's a bit
sketchy right now but submissions are welcome.
.Ip "\s-1XML:\s0:Parser" 4
.IX Item "XML::Parser"
\&\fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR is built on top of \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Parser\fR, so if you have \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR
working you already have \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Parser\fR installed.  This is a comprehensive,
fast, industrial strength (non-validating) parsing tool built on top of James
Clark's 'expat' library.  It does support converting \s-1XML\s0 into a Perl tree
structure (with full support for mixed content) but for arbritrarily large
documents you're probably better off defining handler routines for
\&\fB\s-1XML:\s0:Parser\fR to call as each element is parsed.  The distribution includes a
number of sample applications.
.Ip "\s-1XML::DOM\s0" 4
.IX Item "XML::DOM"
The data structure returned by \fB\s-1XML:\s0:Simple\fR was designed for convenience
rather than standards compliance.  \fB\s-1XML::DOM\s0\fR is a parser built on top of
\&\fB\s-1XML:\s0:Parser\fR, which returns a 'Document' object conforming to the \s-1API\s0 of the
Document Object Model as described at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1 .
This Document object can then be examined, modified and written back out to a
file or converted to a string. 
.Ip "\s-1XML:\s0:Grove" 4
.IX Item "XML::Grove"
Compliance with the Document Object Model might be particularly useful when
porting code to or from another language.  However, if you're looking for a

.Ip "\s-1XML:\s0:Twig" 4
.IX Item "XML::Twig"
\&\s-1XML:\s0:Twig offers a tree-oriented interface to a document while still allowing

.IX Item "XML::PYX"
\&\fB\s-1XML::PYX\s0\fR allows you to apply Unix command pipelines (using grep, sed etc) to

text content or stripping out all occurrences of a particular tag without
having to write a Perl script at all.  It can also be used for transforming
\&\s-1HTML\s0 to \s-1XHTML\s0.
.Ip "\s-1XML::RAX\s0" 4
