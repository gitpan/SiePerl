.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
ColourChooser is a dialogue box which allows the user to pick a colour from
the list in rgb.txt (supplied with X Windows), or to create a colour by
setting \s-1RGB\s0 (red, green, blue) values with slider controls.
.PP
You can scroll through all the named colours by using the <Down> and <Up>
arrow keys on the keyboard or by clicking the mouse on the scrollbar and then
clicking the colour list.

.PP
The user has three options: 
.Sh "\s-1OK\s0"
.IX Subsection "OK"
Pressing \s-1OK\s0 will return the selected colour, as a name if it has one or as an
\&\s-1RGB\s0 value if it doesn't. (Colours which do not have names are listed as
\&'Unnamed' in the colour list box.) If the \f(CW\*(C`\-hexonly\*(C'\fR option has been specified
the colour is always returned as a Tk colour hex value, i.e. in the form
\&'#HHHHHH' except if Transparent is chosen in which case 'None' is returned.
.PP
\&\s-1OK\s0 is pressed by a mouse click or <Return> or <o> or <Control-o> or <Alt-o>.
.Sh "Transparent"
.IX Subsection "Transparent"
Pressing Transparent will return the string 'None' which is xpm's name for
transparent.
.PP
Transparent is pressed by a mouse click or <t> or <Control-t> or <Alt-t>.
.Sh "Cancel"
.IX Subsection "Cancel"
Pressing Cancel will return an empty string.
.PP
Cancel is pressed by a mouse click or <Escape> or <c> or <Control-c> or
<Alt-c>. (Note that if the language is not english then the letter to press
will be the first letter of the translation of the word 'Cancel'.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.IX Header "INSTALLATION"
ColourChooser.pm should be placed in any Tk directory in any lib directory in
Perl's \f(CW%INC\fR path, for example, '/usr/lib/perl5/Tk'.
.PP
ColourChooser looks for the file rgb.txt on your system \- if it can't find it
you will only be able to specify colours by \s-1RGB\s0 value.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Does almost no error checking.
.PP
Can be slow to load because rgb.txt is large; however we now load a single
instance of the colour names when the module is first used and these names are
then shared.
.PP
If you scroll the list by keyboard or use the mouse to move the colour sliders
the colour updates as you go; but if you use the mouse on the scrollbar you
must click the colour name box for the colour to update. I don't know why this
is and any advice on how to fix it would be welcome.
