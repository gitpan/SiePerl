.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional 
and object-oriented i/o) on things \fIother\fR than normal filehandles; 
in particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, 
and IO::Lines.
.PP
If you have access to \fItie()\fR, these classes will make use of the
IO::WrapTie module to inherit a convenient \fInew_tie()\fR 
constructor.  It also exports a nice \fIwraptie()\fR function.
.PP
In the more-traditional \s-1IO:\s0:Handle front, we 
have IO::AtomicFile
which may be used to painlessly create files which are updated
atomically.
.PP
And in the \*(L"this-may-prove-useful\*(R" corner, we have IO::Wrap, 
whose exported \fIwraphandle()\fR function will clothe anything that's not
a blessed object in an \s-1IO:\s0:Handle-like wrapper... so you can just
use \s-1OO\s0 syntax and stop worrying about whether your function's caller
handed you a string, a globref, or a FileHandle.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.IX Header "INSTALLATION"
Most of you already know the drill...
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    perl Makefile.PL
\&    make test
\&    make install
.Ve
For everyone else out there...
if you've never installed Perl code before, or you're trying to use
this in an environment where your sysadmin or \s-1ISP\s0 won't let you do
interesting things, \fBrelax:\fR since this module contains no binary 
extensions, you can cheat.  That means copying the directory tree
under my \*(L"./lib\*(R" directory into someplace where your script can \*(L"see\*(R" 
it.  For example, under Linux:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    cp -r IO-stringy-1.234/lib/* /path/to/my/perl/
.Ve
Now, in your Perl code, do this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use lib "/path/to/my/perl";
\&    use IO::Scalar;                   ### or whatever
.Ve
Ok, now you've been told.  At this point, anyone who whines about
not being given enough information gets an unflattering haiku 
written about them in the next change log.  I'll do it.  
Don't think I won't.

.Ip "(2000/08/02)  Finalize $/ support" 4
.IX Item "(2000/08/02)  Finalize $/ support"
Graham Barr submitted this patch half a \fIyear\fR ago; 
Like a moron, I lost his message under a ton of others,
and only now have the experimental implementation done.
.Sp
Will the sudden sensitivity to $/ hose anyone out there?
I'm worried, so you have to enable it explicitly.
.Ip "(2000/09/28)  Separate read/write cursors?" 4
.IX Item "(2000/09/28)  Separate read/write cursors?"
Binkley sent me a very interesting variant of \s-1IO:\s0:Scalar which
maintains two separate cursors on the data, one for reading
and one for writing.  Quoth he:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    Isn't it the case that real operating system file descriptors 
\&    maintain an independent read and write file position (and 
\&    seek(2) resets them both)?
.Ve
He also pointed out some issues with his implementation:  
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    For example, what does eof or tell return?  The read position or 
\&    the write position?  (I assumed read position was more important).
.Ve
Your opinions on this are most welcome.
(Me, I'm just squeamish that this will break some code
which depends on the existing behavior, and that attempts to
maintain backwards-compatibility will slow down the code.
But I'll give it a shot.)

.Ip "Version 1.220   (2001/04/03)" 4
.IX Item "Version 1.220   (2001/04/03)"
Added untested \s-1SEEK\s0, \s-1TELL\s0, and \s-1EOF\s0 methods to \s-1IO:\s0:Scalar 
and \s-1IO:\s0:ScalarArray to support corresponding functions for
tied filehandles: untested, because I'm still running 5.00556 
and Perl is complaining about \*(L"\fItell()\fR on unopened file\*(R".
\&\fIThanks to Graham Barr for the suggestion.\fR
.Sp
Removed not-fully-blank lines from modules; these were causing
lots of POD-related warnings.  
\&\fIThanks to Nicolas Joly for the suggestion.\fR

\&\s-1IO:\s0:Scalar objects can now be made sensitive to $/ .
Pains were taken to keep the fast code fast while adding this feature.
\&\fICheers to Graham Barr for submitting his patch; 
jeers to me for losing his email for 6 months.\fR
.Ip "Version 1.218   (2001/02/23)" 4

\&\s-1IO:\s0:Scalar has a new \fIsysseek()\fR method.
\&\fIThanks again to Richard Jones.\fR
.Sp
New \*(L"\s-1TO\s0 \s-1DO\s0\*(R" section, because people who submit patches/ideas should 
at least know that they're in the system... and that I won't lose
their stuff.  Please read it.  
.Sp
New entries in the section on "AUTHOR".  
Please read those too.
.Ip "Version 1.216   (2000/09/28)" 4

\&\fB\s-1IO:\s0:Scalar and \s-1IO:\s0:ScalarArray now inherit from \s-1IO:\s0:Handle.\fR
I thought I'd remembered a problem with this ages ago, related to
the fact that these \s-1IO::\s0 modules don't have \*(L"real\*(R" filehandles,
but the problem apparently isn't surfacing now.  
If you suddenly encounter Perl warnings during global destruction
(especially if you're using tied filehandles), then please let me know!
\&\fIThanks to B. K. Oxley (binkley) for this.\fR
.Sp
\&\fBNasty bug fixed in \s-1IO:\\f(BIs0:Scalar::write()\fB.\fR
Apparently, the offset and the number-of-bytes arguments were,
for all practical purposes, \fIreversed.\fR  You were okay if
you did all your writing with \fIprint()\fR, but boy was \fIthis\fR a stupid bug!  
\&\fIThanks to Richard Jones for finding this one.

to true.  (Whew.  Glad I caught this before it went to \s-1CPAN\s0.)
