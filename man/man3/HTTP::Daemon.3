.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Instances of the \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon\fR class are \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1 servers that
listen on a socket for incoming requests. The \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon\fR is a
sub-class of \fI\s-1IO:\s0:Socket::INET\fR, so you can perform socket operations
directly on it too.
.PP
The \fIaccept()\fR method will return when a connection from a client is
available. The returned value will be a reference to a object of the
\&\fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon::ClientConn\fR class which is another \fI\s-1IO:\s0:Socket::INET\fR
subclass. Calling the \fIget_request()\fR method on this object will read
data from the client and return an \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Request\fR object reference.
.PP
This \s-1HTTP\s0 daemon does not \fIfork\fR\|(2) for you.  Your application, i.e. the
user of the \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon\fR is reponsible for forking if that is
desirable.  Also note that the user is responsible for generating
responses that conform to the \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1 protocol.  The
\&\fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon::ClientConn\fR class provides some methods that make this easier.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
The following is a list of methods that are new (or enhanced) relative
to the \fI\s-1IO:\s0:Socket::INET\fR base class.
.Ip "$d = new \s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon" 4
.IX Item "$d = new HTTP::Daemon"
The constructor takes the same parameters as the
\&\fI\s-1IO:\s0:Socket::INET\fR constructor.  It can also be called without specifying
any parameters. The daemon will then set up a listen queue of 5
connections and allocate some random port number.  A server that wants
to bind to some specific address on the standard \s-1HTTP\s0 port will be
constructed like this:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  $d = new HTTP::Daemon
\&        LocalAddr => 'www.someplace.com',
\&        LocalPort => 80;
.Ve
.Ip "$c = \f(CW$d\fR->accept([$pkg])" 4
.IX Item "$c = $d->accept([$pkg])"
This method is the same as \fI\s-1IO:\s0:Socket::accept\fR but returns an
\&\fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon::ClientConn\fR reference by default.  It returns
undef if you specify a timeout and no connection is made within
that time.
.Ip "$d->url" 4
.IX Item "$d->url"
Returns a \s-1URL\s0 string that can be used to access the server root.
.Ip "$d->product_tokens" 4
.IX Item "$d->product_tokens"
Returns the name that this server will use to identify itself.  This
is the string that is sent with the \fIServer\fR response header.  The
main reason to have this method is that subclasses can override it if
they want to use another product name.
.PP
The \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon::ClientConn\fR is also a \fI\s-1IO:\s0:Socket::INET\fR
subclass. Instances of this class are returned by the \fIaccept()\fR method
of \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon\fR.  The following additional methods are
provided:
.Ip "$c->get_request([$headers_only])" 4
.IX Item "$c->get_request([$headers_only])"
Read data from the client and turn it into an
\&\fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Request\fR object which is then returned.  It returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
if reading of the request fails.  If it fails, then the
\&\fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon::ClientConn\fR object ($c) should be discarded, and you
should not call this method again.  The \f(CW$c\fR->reason method might give
you some information about why \f(CW$c\fR->get_request returned \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \f(CW$c\fR->get_request method supports \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1 request content bodies,
including \fIchunked\fR transfer encoding with footer and self delimiting
\&\fImultipart/*\fR content types.
.Sp
The \f(CW$c\fR->get_request method will normally not return until the whole
request has been received from the client.  This might not be what you
want if the request is an upload of a multi-mega-byte file (and with
chunked transfer encoding \s-1HTTP\s0 can even support infinite request
messages \- uploading live audio for instance).  If you pass a \s-1TRUE\s0
value as the \f(CW$headers_only\fR argument, then \f(CW$c\fR->get_request will return
immediately after parsing the request headers and you are responsible
for reading the rest of the request content.  If you are going to
call \f(CW$c\fR->get_request again on the same connection you better read the
correct number of bytes.
.Ip "$c->read_buffer([$new_value])" 4
.IX Item "$c->read_buffer([$new_value])"
Bytes read by \f(CW$c\fR->get_request, but not used are placed in the \fIread
buffer\fR.  The next time \f(CW$c\fR->get_request is called it will consume the
bytes in this buffer before reading more data from the network
connection itself.  The read buffer is invalid after \f(CW$c\fR->get_request
has returned an undefined value.
.Sp
If you handle the reading of the request content yourself you need to
empty this buffer before you read more and you need to place
unconsumed bytes here.  You also need this buffer if you implement
services like \fI101 Switching Protocols\fR.
.Sp
This method always return the old buffer content and can optionally
replace the buffer content if you pass it an argument.
.Ip "$c->reason" 4
.IX Item "$c->reason"
When \f(CW$c\fR->get_request returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR you can obtain a short string
describing why it happened by calling \f(CW$c\fR->reason.
.Ip "$c->proto_ge($proto)" 4
.IX Item "$c->proto_ge($proto)"
Return \s-1TRUE\s0 if the client announced a protocol with version number
greater or equal to the given argument.  The \f(CW$proto\fR argument can be a
string like \*(L"\s-1HTTP/1\s0.1\*(R" or just \*(L"1.1\*(R".
.Ip "$c->antique_client" 4
.IX Item "$c->antique_client"
Return \s-1TRUE\s0 if the client speaks the \s-1HTTP/0\s0.9 protocol.  No status
code and no headers should be returned to such a client.  This should
be the same as !$c->proto_ge(\*(L"\s-1HTTP/1\s0.0\*(R").
.Ip "$c->force_last_request" 4
.IX Item "$c->force_last_request"
Make sure that \f(CW$c\fR->get_request will not try to read more requests off
this connection.  If you generate a response that is not self
delimiting, then you should signal this fact by calling this method.
.Sp
This attribute is turned on automatically if the client announces
protocol \s-1HTTP/1\s0.0 or worse and does not include a \*(L"Connection:
Keep-Alive\*(R" header.  It is also turned on automatically when \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1
or better clients send the \*(L"Connection: close\*(R" request header.
.Ip "$c->send_status_line( [$code, [$mess, [$proto]]] )" 4
.IX Item "$c->send_status_line( [$code, [$mess, [$proto]]] )"
Send the status line back to the client.  If \f(CW$code\fR is omitted 200 is
assumed.  If \f(CW$mess\fR is omitted, then a message corresponding to \f(CW$code\fR
is inserted.  If \f(CW$proto\fR is missing the content of the
\&\f(CW$HTTP::Daemon::PROTO\fR variable is used.
.Ip "$c->send_crlf" 4
.IX Item "$c->send_crlf"
Send the \s-1CRLF\s0 sequence to the client.
.Ip "$c->send_basic_header( [$code, [$mess, [$proto]]] )" 4
.IX Item "$c->send_basic_header( [$code, [$mess, [$proto]]] )"
Send the status line and the \*(L"Date:\*(R" and \*(L"Server:\*(R" headers back to
the client.  This header is assumed to be continued and does not end
with an empty \s-1CRLF\s0 line.
.Ip "$c->send_response( [$res] )" 4
.IX Item "$c->send_response( [$res] )"
Write a \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Response\fR object to the
client as a response.  We try hard to make sure that the response is
self delimiting so that the connection can stay persistent for further
request/response exchanges.
.Sp
The content attribute of the \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Response\fR object can be a normal
string or a subroutine reference.  If it is a subroutine, then
whatever this callback routine returns is written back to the
client as the response content.  The routine will be called until it
return an undefined or empty value.  If the client is \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1 aware
then we will use chunked transfer encoding for the response.
.Ip "$c->send_redirect( \f(CW$loc\fR, [$code, [$entity_body]] )" 4
.IX Item "$c->send_redirect( $loc, [$code, [$entity_body]] )"
Send a redirect response back to the client.  The location ($loc) can
be an absolute or relative \s-1URL\s0. The \f(CW$code\fR must be one the redirect
status codes, and defaults to \*(L"301 Moved Permanently\*(R"
.Ip "$c->send_error( [$code, [$error_message]] )" 4
.IX Item "$c->send_error( [$code, [$error_message]] )"
Send an error response back to the client.  If the \f(CW$code\fR is missing a
\&\*(L"Bad Request\*(R" error is reported.  The \f(CW$error_message\fR is a string that
is incorporated in the body of the \s-1HTML\s0 entity body.
.Ip "$c->send_file_response($filename)" 4
.IX Item "$c->send_file_response($filename)"
Send back a response with the specified \f(CW$filename\fR as content.  If the
file is a directory we try to generate an \s-1HTML\s0 index of it.
.Ip "$c->send_file($fd);" 4
.IX Item "$c->send_file($fd);"
Copy the file to the client.  The file can be a string (which
will be interpreted as a filename) or a reference to an \fI\s-1IO:\s0:Handle\fR
or glob.
.Ip "$c->daemon" 4
.IX Item "$c->daemon"
Return a reference to the corresponding \fI\s-1HTTP:\s0:Daemon\fR object.
